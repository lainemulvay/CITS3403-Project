You see in your Unit Outline that the assignment is weighted at 50% of the final mark and the mid-semester test is weighted at 10% of the final mark. Ultimately, this means that if you score 20 out of 30 for both pieces of assessment, the mid-semester test contributes 6.6 marks (20/30 of 10 marks) and the major assignment contributes 33.3 marks (20/30 of 50 marks) to your final result."

Pre-ordered paper documents will be available to collect two working days after the release of results; for digital documents you will receive an email after your graduation ceremony to confirm that your document is online and ready for you to access via a registration link for your personalised My eQuals portal. If you order a hardcopy transcript to be collected from Student Central, you will not receive an email to let you know when your document is ready to be collected as the processing times listed on the website are guaranteed. 
Orders and collections are unavailable during the University shutdown period."
Can I receive an electronic copy of my Statement of Academic Record?,"Students have the option to order a digital version of their UWA Statement of Academic Record (transcript) issued via My eQuals. Digital documents issued via My eQuals are securely stored and available to you anytime and anywhere, saving you time and money.
Once UWA has uploaded your requested document, you can use My eQuals to safely share your documents with anyone, at any time, for however long you like. When you share a document from the repository, the person you invite to view your document will receive an email directly from My eQuals (Digitary) and not from your student email account. This is how external organisations can know this is a legitimate document coming from the secure repository.
You still have the option to order a paper (hard copy) version of your Statement of Academic Record and other official academic documents.
Hard copy academic documents and records are printed on official UWA secure paper. In order to maintain the integrity of these documents, to verify that they are authentic, and to avoid fraudulent alterations they cannot be emailed. Once you have received a hard copy document, you can then scan your own copy as required. Authenticated soft-copy academic documents can be ordered and will be available via My eQuals."
What is a Statement of Qualification?,"A Statement of Qualification (or Letter of Completion) is an official hardcopy University document that can be used as evidence that you have completed the requirements of your course of study, and is often used by students who have completed their studies but not yet graduated. This statement does not include information of any studies undertaken at CELT (Centre for English Language Teaching) or UWA College.
 
The Statement of Qualification is printed on official UWA secure paper and signed by the Associate Director, Student Services & Engagement. The document states:

Your full name
Your student ID
Your courses
The dates you commenced and completed your award/s
The date of your graduation/s (if applicable)
Confirmation that all instruction at the University of Western Australia is taught in English

Current students can order and pay for their Statement via studentConnect. Past graduates can use the online portal for order and payment.
 
Statements of Qualification are produced as hard copy documents only. If you would like a digital document, you may wish to order a Statement of Academic Record, or wait until you graduate when you'll receive free access to a digital copy of your degree certificate and AHEGS via My eQuals."
I have completed my course and want to apply for Australian Permanent Residency. What documentation do I need?,"When you apply for Australian Permanent Residency you may need to order documents from Student Central to support your application, such as a Statement of Academic Record and/or a Statement of Qualification. 
It’s a good idea for you to check with the Department of Home Affairs to find out exactly what documentation you will need.
You can see examples of documents on our current student website, and can place your order through the Online Portal."
Can I order express documents?,"Student Central provides Express and Next Day services for documents you require urgently. Due to processing times, the option to order express or next day services varies depending on the document type.

Express orders will be ready three University working hours after we receive your completed order via the Online Portal or in person at Student Central.
Next day orders will be ready by 12:00pm the following University business day after we receive your completed order via the Online Portal or in person at Student Central.

You can see samples of our documents, prices, delivery options, and information on how to place an order on our Academic documents web page.
Documents can be collected during Student Administration opening hours, and are not available to order or collect over the University shutdown period."
When can I order my Statement of Academic Record to show my latest semester results?,"To make sure all of your results are included on your Statement of Academic Record, you can:

Place your order after results have been officially released and you can see them on studentConnect. If you're studying outside of the main semesters, refer to the important dates for non-standard teaching periods; or
Pre-order your Statement of Academic Record via studentConnect by selecting the box ‘After the main release of semester results’. This option will only be available to select 45 days prior to the release of semester 1 and semester 2 results. If you're studying outside the main semester teaching periods, this option may not be applicable to you."
Can someone else collect my Academic Document(s) on my behalf?,"If you can’t make it in to see us and don’t want your document posted, we’re happy for you to authorise someone to collect your documents on your behalf. 
When you place your order online (either through the online portal or studentConnect) you have the option to provide the name of the person who you’ve organised to collect your document in the field 'Person collecting order'. The person collecting the document will simply need to show their photographic ID when they come in to collect your order.

If you have chosen to collect your document yourself but find that you’re no longer able to, you can nominate someone else to collect it for you (or arrange another delivery method) by emailing us from the same email address that you used when you placed your order. The email should include the document you ordered, and the full name of the person collecting your document. The person collecting the document will need to show their photographic ID to collect your document."
There is an error on my Statement of Academic Record. Who do I contact?,"If you believe there is an error on your Statement of Academic Record (transcript), contact Student Administration via Email Us to let us know.
A staff member from Student Administration will respond to your query as soon as possible and investigate further."
Can I have my Statement of Academic Record sent to another institution or third party?,"There are several options for sharing your Statement of Academic Record (transcript) with a third party.
Sending a digital document: 
Once your order for a digital Statement of Academic Record has been processed, you'll be able to view and share it through your My eQuals account. 
You can share your document as many times as you like, and it’s as easy as generating a link to send as part of your application, or downloading the document as a PDF/A to attach to an application. When you share your document, the email the third party receives is from a secure My eQuals UWA email address, so is coming from UWA at your request. More information on sharing documents is available on the My eQuals FAQs and help section.
Sending a paper document:
When you place an order in studentConnect (or for past students through the online portal) you can request that we post your academic documents to another institution or third party by providing their delivery details. 
Simply select the relevant postage option and provide the address, a contact person and their telephone number, and any reference number you've been instructed to use in the 'Special delivery instructions' box. Your academic documents will be sent in a sealed envelope on your behalf. 
You can see examples of documents and delivery options on our current student website."
How do I change my name on my Statement of Academic Record?,"Your name can be changed on your Statement of Academic Record (transcript) by presenting one of the following original documents to Student Administration with evidence that links your former and current name:

A Change of Name certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (change of name)
A Marriage Certificate (change of birth name to married name) and a second piece of evidence to show that you are now known legally by the married name, for example, a driver's licence or passport.
A Birth Certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (displaying a change of name)

If you can't come to Student Administration to provide the original documentation, you can send us a full-size colour scan via Email Us."
Can the order of my name be changed on my testamur?,"You will be able to rearrange the order of your names that appear on your testamur (degree certificate) by following the prompts during the online application process. You do not need to present any legal documentation during this process, provided it is simply changing the order of the names that we already have recorded for you. If you need to add in a missing name, contact us before you graduate – once you have graduated your name as it appears on the testamur can only be changed in limited circumstances.
Note: Whilst you are able to rearrange the order of your names on your testamur, all other official documentation (such as your transcript) will appear as given name/s followed by your surname."
Can I have any information or unit results removed from my Statement of Academic Record?,"Your Statement of Academic Record (transcript) is the official record of all your studies at the University. It will include all course and unit attempts including failed or withdrawn units and cannot be altered to include additional information, or have results omitted."

What is FEE-HELP?,"FEE‑HELP is a loan scheme that assists eligible domestic fee paying students to pay all or part of their tuition fees. A FEE-HELP loan does not cover additional study costs such as accommodation, laptops or text books. 
The total amount of FEE-HELP that you can borrow is part of your combined HELP loan limit. The combined HELP loan limit is a cap on what you can borrow from the Australian Government to cover the costs of your tuition fees. 







Postgraduate fee-paying places
Eligible domestic students can borrow all or part of their tuition fees through FEE-HELP. No loan fee applies to loans for postgraduate studies.
FEE-HELP loans are repaid through the Australian taxation system. If you are eligible for FEE-HELP assistance and would like to obtain a FEE-HELP loan you must complete and submit an online request for FEE-HELP on studentConnect and provide your Tax File Number (TFN) by the census date.
HELP loan limit
From 1 January 2020, a combined HELP loan limit replaced the FEE-HELP limit and includes FEE-HELP, VET Student Loans, VET FEE-HELP and HECS-HELP. Only new HECS-HELP borrowing will count towards a person's HELP limit; however, any existing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP or VET Student Loans that you borrowed before 2020 will be carried over.
HELP loan limits in 2023
For 2023, the HELP loan limit is $113,028 for most students. The limit for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses leading to initial registration, or eligible aviation courses with census dates in 2023 will be $162,336.
Renewable HELP balance
The renewable HELP balance is your available borrowing capacity for HECS-HELP, FEE HELP, VET FEE HELP and VET Student Loans. It will be your available HELP balance. Your available HELP balance is your HELP loan limit of that given year, minus your HECS-HELP, FEE HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET Student Loans borrowing. Taking out a loan will reduce your available HELP balance, and making a repayment will increase your available HELP balance.
Further information on HELP loans is available on the Study Assist website."
What is HECS-HELP?,"HECS‑HELP is a loan scheme for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth Supported Places to pay their student contribution amounts (tuition fees). It cannot be used for additional study costs such as accommodation or text books.
HECS-HELP loans are repaid through the Australian taxation system, and you must provide the University with your Tax File Number (TFN) to use the scheme.







You are eligible for HECS-HELP if you:

Are enrolled in a unit of study by the census date, as a Commonwealth Supported student;
Meet the citizenship and residency requirements:
	a) an Australian citizen (studying at least part of your course in Australia);
	b) the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit/s; or
	c) a New Zealand Special Category Visa holder who meets the long-term residency requirements.

If you are eligible and wish to access the HECS-HELP loan scheme you must complete and submit an electronic 'Request for a Commonwealth supported place and HECS-HELP loan' form (eCAF) online via studentConnect on or before the census date of the unit and supply your Tax File Number (TFN) and Unique Student Identifier (USI). You can complete the eCAF as part of your online enrolment or by selecting Commonwealth Assistance form in the Finance menu on studentConnect. 
HELP loan limits in 2020
From 1 January 2020, the government introduced limits to how much HECS-HELP you can borrow. The new combined HELP loan limit replaced the FEE-HELP limit and includes FEE-HELP, VET Student Loans, VET FEE-HELP and HECS-HELP. The 'combined HELP loan limit' is a cap, limiting the amount of HELP that you can borrow. Only new HECS-HELP borrowing counts towards your HELP limit. This means that any HECS-HELP loans borrowed before 2020 will not count towards your new HELP limit; however, any FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP or VET Student Loans that counted towards your FEE-HELP limit will count towards your new HELP limit.
From the 2019-20 income year, you can top up your HELP balance by making repayments on your loan. Repayments starting from the 2019-20 income year will top up a person's HELP balance. Any compulsory or voluntary repayments can be re-borrowed in the future, up to the current HELP loan limit.
More information on HECS-HELP can be found on the Study Assist website."
How much will my tuition fees be?,"Domestic Students
Your tuition fees depend on:

The course in which you are enrolled,
The units that you study, and
Whether you are a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) student or a Full Fee Paying student.

Information on UWA's undergraduate and postgraduate course costs can be found on the Fees Calculator. Annual fees are updated on the calculator generally in November-December each year. Tuition fees are due to be paid in full by no later than the census date of the unit teaching period. Alternatively, if eligible to utilise a HELP loan, the completed Commonwealth Assistance Form (eCAF) must be completed on studentConnect and your tax file number provided by no later than census.
Every unit at UWA has been allocated to a fee band and has an associated study load. Unit fees are calculated using this information, along with the unit classification (undergraduate or postgraduate), and whether you are an Australian Commonwealth Supported or Full Fee Paying student, international student, or taking the unit through AccessUWA (assessed or non-assessed). 

International Students
If you are an international student studying in Australia, course costs can be found by using the Fees Calculator. Annual fees are updated on the calculator generally in November-December each year. Fees are due to be paid in full by no later than the end of the first week of each semester."
I no longer wish to receive FEE-HELP loans. What do I do?,"If you no longer wish to receive FEE-HELP loans, you need to notify the UWA Fees team in writing that you wish to cancel your request for FEE-HELP assistance.
Submit your request via Email Us from your UWA student email address and make sure to include:

Your full name;
Your student ID; and 
The date the cancellation of FEE-HELP is to be effective from.

Once your FEE-HELP is cancelled, you will be recorded as a Full Fee Paying student and must comply with the payment due dates issued on your Statement of Account (available on studentConnect under the Finance menu)."
How can I pay my student contribution or tuition fees?,"There are several ways you can pay your student fees at UWA.
Note: Any payments made toward your account will be credited to the first outstanding debt/charge listed on your electronic Statement of Account (eSOA). Only after any outstanding fees have been paid will the balance of your payment be credited against your tuition fees. Therefore, it is important you check studentConnect for any outstanding payments.
You can pay your fees using one of the following methods:

Online via your eSOA available on studentConnect.


You will need to retrieve your eSOA by logging in to studentConnect with your student ID and Pheme password.
Click on 'Statement of Account'  in the FINANCE menu on the left hand side.
Select the relevant 'Fee calendar' from the drop down box. 
Click 'Show'.
Click 'Pay Now'.
Proceed to make the payment.


Online via the Outstanding Balance page available on studentConnect.


You will need to view your outstanding balance by logging in to studentConnect with your student ID and Pheme password.
Click on 'Outstanding Balance' in the FINANCE menu on the left hand side.
Click 'Make a payment'.
Proceed to make the payment.


You can present your Statement of Account intact at any Australia Post Agency to pay by cash, EFTPOS, Personal or Bank cheque/money order (drawn from an Australian bank in Australian dollars). For payment by cheque/money order in person at Australia Post, make your cheque/money order payable to ""Australia Post"".
Payment can be made by MasterCard or Visa by telephone on 13 18 16 (or from overseas on 61 13 18 16) or on the internet via Postbillpay. You will need to quote the bill pay code and reference number from your Statement of Account.

	CRAWLEY WA 6009"
What is a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP)?,"A Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) is a place at a university or higher education provider where the government pays part of your tuition fees. This part is a subsidy, not a loan, and you don't have to pay it back to the government. The subsidy does not cover the entire cost of your study. Students must pay the rest of the cost, which is called the 'student contribution amount'.
Currently all domestic undergraduate places at UWA are offered as CSPs (subject to students meeting ongoing eligibility criteria). UWA offers a limited number of postgraduate Commonwealth Supported Places in certain courses based on government eligibility criteria requirements; see the UWA Fee Calculator for a list of courses.

If you are enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you:

Are known as a Commonwealth Supported student
Have been issued with a Commonwealth Higher Education Student Support Number (CHESSN) (if you commenced studies between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020), and
May be eligible to defer all or part of your student contributions through the loan scheme HECS-HELP. If you are eligible, you must fill out a HECS-HELP form online via studentConnect by the census date of the unit to defer your student contribution amount.

A student contribution payment cannot be accepted after the census date for a unit; however, eligible students who have filled out their HECS-HELP form and provided their Tax File Number (TFN) by the census date will normally have their debt automatically deferred via the HECS-HELP loan scheme. If you complete the HECS-HELP form after the census date, you will not be able to defer payments until the following semester."
What is the cost of each unit that I am studying?,"Domestic students
You can calculate the estimated cost of each unit you are studying by referring to the UWA Fees Calculator for a detailed breakdown. Tuition fees are reviewed annually and may be subject to an annual increase.
International students
You are charged tuition fees on the basis of the course in which you are enrolled, not the individual units. You can calculate the estimated cost of your course based on enrolment load by referring to the UWA Fees Calculator for a detailed breakdown. Tuition fees are reviewed annually and may be subject to an increase of no more than 7.5% annually."
What is a CHESSN?,"A Commonwealth Higher Education Student Support Number (CHESSN) is a unique identifier provided by the Commonwealth government that was allocated to students who commenced  studies from 1 January 2015 onwards. The CHESSN was used by the University to report any HELP loan amounts you have used for your studies to the government, and can be found on your Commonwealth Assistance Notices (CAN) on studentConnect.
From 2021, the Australian Government is decommissioning the CHESSN and extending the USI throughout the higher education sector; therefore creating a single student identifier for your entire tertiary education journey. 
You can still use your CHESSN to access the myHELPbalance portal to keep track of your loan usage (how much more HELP or VSL assistance you can receive before you reach the HELP limit).
If you are a continuing student, you should get your USI as soon as possible. From 2023, all students, old or new, Australian or international, must have a USI to be able to graduate and receive their qualification.
See: USI requirements for UWA students"
I have just paid my fees. Why have I received a Payment Reminder email?,"Any payment/s you make may take up to 2 - 5 working days to be credited to your student account. Check the date of issue on the top right-hand corner of your electronic Statement of Account (eSOA). If this falls within 2 - 5 working days of your payment it is most likely that your account was not credited when the electronic Statement of Account was issued.
Log on to studentConnect to check your 'Received Payments' under the Finance menu. If after 2 - 5 working days your payment does not appear contact Student Administration via Email Us."
When do I receive an invoice for my tuition fees?,"You will receive an electronic Statement of Account (eSoA) on studentConnect. Hardcopy Statement of Accounts will not be mailed to you.

Semester 1 - Your electronic Statement of Account (eSoA) will be available on your studentConnect in the last week of January if you have enrolled in units by then.  

Semester 2 - Your electronic Statement of Account (eSoA) will be available on your studentConnect in the last week of June if you have enrolled in units by then.

Non-standard Semesters - Your electronic Statement of Account (eSoA) will be available on your studentConnect generally one week prior to the start of the non-standard semester.
If you enrol in units after the dates above, an eSoA will be issued to you via studentConnect overnight.
You will also receive a revised Statement of Account (eSoA) after any of the following:

You add/discontinue any units to your enrolment and this changes your fee liability,
You change your payment option e.g. elect to defer payment via HELP loan if eligible,
You make a payment,
The status of a unit changes from INVALID to ENROLLED - this changes your fee liability, or
Your payment is not enough to cover your current fees and past debts."
How much will I pay for a postgraduate course?,The tuition fees for postgraduate courses vary depending on what you are studying and your student type. You can view the postgraduate tuition fees by using the UWA Fees Calculator.
Where can I access the University's Fee Policy?,"You can access information on University Fee Policies at the University Policy website.
Further information regarding fees can be found on the Fees and Payments website, and in the Student Handbook."
What is the importance of the census date?,"The Census Date is the last date that you can withdraw from a unit without financial liability.
Every unit offered at UWA has its own Census Date. The Census Dates for standard semesters are:

Semester 1 = 31 March
Semester 2 = 31 August

Full details of the Teaching periods, census and withdrawal dates (including non-standard teaching periods) are published on our Current Students' website.
Please check the Census Dates for all units in which you are enrolled, and regularly check your enrolment on studentConnect.
Withdrawing from a unit:
Domestic students: If you withdraw on or before the Census Date of a unit and you have paid your tuition fees or student contribution, you will automatically receive a full refund for the unit. If you have deferred payment through a Commonwealth Loan Scheme, you will not incur a FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP debt for the unit.
International students: Please contact Student Central or Email Us for information on the financial implications of withdrawing by the census date. More information can be found on the UWA Fees & Payments page."
Do I get a refund for any fees I have paid if I withdraw before or on the census date?,"If you are a Domestic Student and you withdraw on or before the census date for your unit(s), you will receive a refund of any student contribution or tuition fees paid, approximately one month after the relevant census date.

If you are an International Student, your fees for the semester are based on your unit enrolment on the first day of semester. If you subsequently enrol in more units, your Statement of Account and outstanding balance will be updated on studentConnect. If you withdraw from units, any fees paid will be held in credit towards your next semester's fees. If you withdraw totally from your course, you should refer to the refund policy (as stipulated in your acceptance contract) for information about your refund eligibility. 
A refund will normally be issued using your nominated bank account details on studentConnect (under the Finance menu).
Log on to studentConnect and ensure your bank details, contact details and enrolment are correct and up to date. It may delay your refund, if your information is not correct."
How can I check that the University has received my payment?,"You can check your account balance (including payments made) on studentConnect.
Under the ""Finance"" menu, select ""Received Payments"". Please allow 4-5 working days for payments to be credited to your student account."
What happens if I don't pay my student contribution or tuition fees on time?,"You must pay your tuition fees or student contribution (for Commonwealth Supported Students) by the due date on your Statement of Account. If you do not make payment by the due date you will be charged a late payment fee and your unit enrolment may be cancelled. You can view your outstanding balance, Statement of Account, due dates and census dates for your enrolled teaching periods under the ""Finance"" menu on studentConnect.
Commonwealth Supported Students
If you are a domestic student in a Commonwealth Supported Place, for whom deferral of payment via HECS-HELP is not an option, and your student contribution remains unpaid after the census date of the teaching period, your unit(s) enrolment will be cancelled. Remember, you must pay all compulsory or voluntary payments for tuition fees by the relevant census date. Payments will not be accepted after this date.

Domestic Fee-Paying Students
If you are a Domestic Fee Paying student, who has not deferred payment via FEE-HELP and your fees remain unpaid after the census date, your enrolment will be cancelled.
International Students (studying in Australia)
If you are an International student, your tuition fees are due on the first day of the teaching period and must be paid by the end of week 1 of semester (as stipulated in your acceptance contract). If you do not make payment by this date you will be charged a late payment fee and an encumbrance will be placed on your record. The encumbrance will block you from obtaining formal academic documents or transcripts, re-enrolling and graduating. Your encumbrance will be lifted after your overdue fees are paid. Remember, non-payment can also result in the cancellation of your Student Visa. You must contact Student Central if you are experiencing difficulties paying your tuition fees."
Why is checking my enrolment so important?,"Checking your enrolment is important and can be easily done on studentConnect.

If you are a past student then you can obtain your Commonwealth Assistance Notices (CAN) by contacting the Student Administration Fees Team via Email Us."
Will my previous studies affect my Student Learning Entitlement (SLE)?,"There have been a number of iterations of the Student Learning Entitlement (SLE) introduced or abolished by various governments.
Abolishment of SLE from 2012
The introduction of the demand driven system from 1 January 2012 abolished the then-existing student learning entitlement (SLE). From 1 January 2012, eligibility for Commonwealth Supported Places no longer depended on a student having sufficient SLE to cover their study.
Introduction of SLE from 1 January 2022
On 1 January 2022 the government introduced a new SLE, which gives students 7 years of full-time subsidised study in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP). Your SLE will not reduce for any study undertaken before 1 January 2022, only units of study with a census date after 1 January 2022 will count towards your SLE amount.
Refer to the Study Assist website for further information."
I am an Access UWA student. What are my fees?,"Your AccessUWA unit fees vary depending on the unit(s) in which you are enrolled and whether you enrol as an assessed or non-assessed student.

Note: You must complete the Request for a Commonwealth supported place and HECS-HELP loan (Commonwealth Assistance) form to confirm your request for a Commonwealth Supported Place, and to indicate how you wish to pay for your fees. Submit the form online via studentConnect by selecting Commonwealth Assistance Form in the Finance menu, completing your details and clicking Submit.
Full up-front payment (available to all Commonwealth supported students)
To make a full up-front payment (100%) of your student contribution for all the units you are undertaking as part of a course of study you must make this payment by the census date for your units.
If you don't intend to obtain a HECS-HELP loan, you are not required to provide your Tax File Number (TFN) on your Request for a Commonwealth supported place and HECS-HELP loan form. However, it is wise to provide your TFN as a precaution. This will ensure that if you are unable to make the up front payment by the census date, you will be able to obtain a HECS-HELP loan and your enrolment will not be cancelled.
If you do not pay your entire student contribution up front and have not provided a TFN on or before the census date, your provider must cancel your enrolment as a Commonwealth supported student.
Partial up-front payment and HECS-HELP (subject to eligibility)
If you pay less than 100% of the student contribution for the units in which you are enrolled in a particular course of study that have the same census date, this is considered to be a partial up-front payment. Partial up-front payments must be made by the census date. If you want to make a partial up-front payment, you must provide your TFN on your Request for a Commonwealth supported place and HECS-HELP loan form to obtain a HECS-HELP loan for the unpaid portion of your student contribution, otherwise your enrolment as a Commonwealth supported student in that unit will be cancelled.
You can request how you wish your partial payment to be allocated to your tuition fees, by clicking on ""Received Payments"" in studentConnect and completing the ""Allocate payments"" tab.
Full deferred - HECS-HELP (subject to eligibility)
To obtain a HECS-HELP loan for all or part of your student contribution, you must have included your TFN on your Request for a Commonwealth supported place and HECS-HELP loan form. As at the census date, your unpaid student contribution amount will be deferred automatically through a HECS-HELP loan, and become a HELP debt."
I am a fee-paying student. Can I pay my tuition fees in instalments?,"Domestic students
You can start paying your tuition fee in instalments once your Electronic Statement of Account (eSOA) is available on studentConnect for the unit/s in which you are currently enrolled. Your final instalment or payment for the unit/s will need to be paid on or by the unit census date otherwise your unit enrolment will be cancelled as per Commonwealth legislation (HESA 2003).
If you are not able to (or choose not to) pay your full fees by the unit census date and you meet the eligibility criteria, you can utilise FEE-HELP for the balance or full amount of the unit fees. A FEE-HELP form must be completed online via studentConnect on or before the unit census date, including provision of your TFN.
International students
Full fees are due by the first week of each semester. It is a condition of your UWA Acceptance contract and, if applicable, CoE and student visa, that all fees are paid on time to avoid cancellation of your enrolment and CoE. More information and options regarding paying by instalment can be found on the UWA Fees and Payments website."
I am a fee paying student. Do I get a discount on my tuition fees if I pay for the full year in advance?,"Discount options are not available at The University of Western Australia. Therefore, it is not possible to receive a discount on your tuition fees if you pay for the full year in advance."

Why did I get a late payment fee and encumbrance?,"If full payment of your tuition fee or SSAF account was not received by the due date you will have received a late payment fee and/or encumbrance. The due date for payment is listed on your electronic Statement of Account (eSoA) for each unit, which can be viewed on studentConnect under the Finance section.
An encumbrance will prevent you from:

Obtaining any documentation from Student Administration
Viewing results
Re-enrolling
Receiving a new Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)
Graduating

Domestic tuition fees:
If your fees remain unpaid beyond the census date for the relevant teaching period, and if deferral through the taxation system is not an option for you, you will have your unit(s) enrolment cancelled. Once cancelled the enrolment cannot be reinstated in that teaching period.
International tuition fees:
If your fees remain unpaid beyond the census date for the relevant teaching period, your unit(s) enrolment and CoE may be cancelled. This may impact on your visa, and we advise that you discuss the possible impact with the Department of Home Affairs."
What is my Student Learning Entitlement (SLE)?,"There have been a number of iterations of the Student Learning Entitlement (SLE) introduced or abolished by various governments.
Abolishment of SLE from 2012
The introduction of the demand driven system from 1 January 2012 abolished the then-existing student learning entitlement (SLE). From 1 January 2012, eligibility for Commonwealth Supported Places no longer depended on a student having sufficient SLE to cover their study.
Introduction of SLE from 1 January 2022
On 1 January 2022 the government introduced a new SLE, which gives students 7 years of full-time subsidised study in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP). This applies to all new commencing eligible students enrolled in a CSP courses, both undergraduate and postgraduate, but not to full fee paying courses. Your SLE will not reduce for any study undertaken before 1 January 2022, only units of study with a census date after 1 January 2022 will count towards your SLE amount.
Refer to the Study Assist website for further information, or the Job-Ready Graduates Bill 2020 for information on the reintroduction of SLE."
I have not received my invoice for tuition fees; how can I get one?,"Your Statement of Account will not be mailed to you. Instead, your electronic Statement of Account (eSOA) is available on studentConnect.
To view your eSOA:

Log in to studentConnect.
Select 'Statement of account' under the 'Finance' menu.
Choose the relevant 'Fee calendar' from the drop down menu.
Click 'Show'.
Payment options and instructions are shown at the bottom of your statement. You can print the statement as a PDF, if you require a hardcopy.
To view all your outstanding fee(s) click on 'Outstanding balance'."
What is Equivalent Full-Time Student Load (EFTSL)?,"EFTSL refers to the Equivalent Full-Time Student Load attributed to a unit. Each unit has a set load (usually based on the number of credit points that the unit is worth), which is listed on your Statement of Enrolment, electronic Statement of Account (eSOA) and online enrolment on studentConnect. EFTSL is one of the components used to calculate your unit fees or student contribution. One EFTSL (1.000) is equivalent to a full time student load for one year.

For standard undergraduate degrees, an annual total of 48 credit points is equivalent to a standard year of full time study (one EFTSL). A standard unit worth 6 credit points will be equivalent to 0.125 EFTSL (6/48). Eight units is a standard full time year load, and 8 x 0.125 = 1.000 EFTSL.
Combined degrees and some postgraduate courses may have different standard annual credit points and the units may have different equivalent full-time student loads (EFTSL)."
Why are my tuition fees for this semester different to last semester?,"Your tuition fees may change for a number of reasons including:


Enrolment in more/less units this semester;


Unit(s) falling under a different fee band to those you have previously studied. (Units in different fee bands have different costs);


Unit(s) are worth a different number of credit points (most units are worth 6 credit points, but some are worth 12 credit points or other credit point amounts);


You have transferred to a new course with different fees;


Your previous enrolment was in a prior academic year (fees are subject to annual review each academic year and may increase).


For more information on your course fees and to price your units, refer to the UWA Fee Calculator."
What do I need to do if I receive a Payment Reminder email?,"If you have made a payment for this fee in the last 4 - 5 business days, you can disregard the reminder email.
If the payment doesn't appear under 'Received Payments' in the Finance menu within 2 - 5 business days, contact the Fees team in Student Administration via Email Us.
If you have not made payment, then you must pay your fees immediately. If you are experiencing difficulties in paying by the final due date, contact the Fees Team in Student Administration (refer to your Electronic Statement of Account for details) via Email Us.
Details about payment methods and instructions are available on studentConnect in your electronic Statement of Account (eSOA).
To view your eSOA:

Log in to studentConnect.
Select `Statement of account' under the Finance menu.
Choose the 'Fee Calendar' from the drop down menu.
Click `Show'.
Payment options and instructions are shown at the bottom of your statement. You can print the statement as a PDF, if you require a hardcopy.
To view all your outstanding fee(s) click on 'Outstanding Balance' in the Finance menu.

Note: If the outstanding fees remain unpaid, you may be subject to a late payment fee and/or your unit enrolment may be cancelled."
What do I do if some of my units are missing from my electronic Commonwealth Assistance Notice (eCAN)?,"Check that the units you are looking for belong to the teaching period to which the issued eCAN refers. eCAN notices are sent out after each census date; not just for semesters one and two. If the units you are enrolled in have a later census date they will be included on a future eCAN.

If a unit shows as ENROLLED on studentConnect but is omitted from your eCAN you must contact the Student Administration Fees Team via Email Us.

You cannot add units to your enrolment after the census date."
Why have I received an electronic Commonwealth Assistance Notice (eCAN)?,"You have received an electronic Commonwealth Assistance Notice (eCAN) on your studentConnect due to institutions legally being required under the Higher Education Support Act (2003), to provide a Commonwealth Assistance Notice to all students who have obtained HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP or OS-HELP assistance and/or who are Commonwealth supported students.

eCANs contain important information about your:

Study load [pre 2012 Student Learning Entitlement consumption expressed as unit weight or EFTSL (Student Learning Entitlement was abolished as of 1 January 2012)].
Fee liability and HELP debt and
CHESSN"
"Am I charged interest on my HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP and OS-HELP?","You are not charged interest on your HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP and OS-HELP loan debt. On 1 June each year HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP and OS-HELP loan debts are indexed (according to a formula based on the Consumer Price Index).
For example, a debt reported for the 31 March 2021 census date will not be indexed until 1 June 2022.

Further information on loan indexation is available on the Study Assist website."
What if I am unable to get my Certificate of Application from the Tax Office?,"If you have mailed your Application for a TFN to the Tax Office and you are unable to get your Certificate of Application from a Tax Office shop front, contact the Tax Office on 1300 650 225. The operator will be able to give you further advice."
"If I change my course of study or my provider, do I need to fill out a new Commonwealth Assistance Form?","If you change your course of study (and therefore have a new course code) or changed provider, you must fill out a new electronic Commonwealth Assistance Form (eCAF) and supply your Tax File Number by the census date. 
An application made for one course does not apply to any other course you may undertake, including Honours. If you change your course of study or change provider and do not complete a new Request for Commonwealth Support and HELP form/s before the relevant census date your enrolment will be cancelled.
This applies to HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, and SA-HELP."
Where can I get information about my HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP accumulated debt once it has been deferred to the ATO?,"You can view your HELP debt and make voluntary repayments via myGov. To access this online service, please refer to the instructions on the ATO website or you can call the ATO on 13 28 61. You will have to advise the ATO of your tax file number (TFN) before they will disclose any personal information to you.
You can also get information from myUniAssist.
myUniAssist is a database that will help you keep track of how much Commonwealth assistance you have used (i.e. how much you have borrowed under the HELP scheme). It is important to note that myUniAssist does not provide your current HELP balance, does not include debts incurred pre-2005 (including those under the former HECS, OLDPS, PELS and BOTPLS schemes), nor will it show any HELP repayments you have made.

There is a time lag between the census date and when your information on myUniAssist gets updated, so to work out your current balance, you may need to add any units you have recently enrolled/are currently enrolled in to the total shown on myUniAssist."
I have withdrawn from a unit(s) after the census date. Can I get my fees or student contribution refunded or credited to future study periods?,"The information below is applicable to domestic students only. International students should refer to the Fee Refund Policy.
You can only apply for a tuition fee refund/remission in limited circumstances when you have withdrawn from a unit after the census date. It's important to be aware that the eligibility criteria for withdrawing from a unit without academic penalty via Special Consideration are not the same as the criteria for applying for fee remission. Fee remission guidelines are governed by Australian government legislation. Please familiarise yourself with the fee remission eligibility criteria.
You can submit a Remission Application Form to apply to have your:


HECS-HELP balance re-credited


Up-front payments of student contributions refunded


FEE-HELP balance re-credited


Tuition fees refunded


Refunds of associated up-front student contribution payments and or remission of associated HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP debts are not automatic; it depends on your circumstances and meeting certain conditions set out by the Commonwealth. Applications are assessed in accordance with the Higher Education Support Act (HESA) 2003.
To submit your completed application form and relevant documentation, contact the UWA Fees Office via Email Us.
Note: Under legislation, the University is not permitted to refund SA-HELP debt and does not refund up front SSAF payments."
Do I have a right of appeal if my remission application is unsuccessful for refund/remission?,"If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your request for refund of associated up-front student contribution payments and/or remission of associated HELP debt, you may appeal to the Fees Office within 28 days from the day you received notice of the outcome.
If additional relevant information or evidence has come to hand which was not available previously and you believe it will impact the outcome of your application, please Email Us with this additional information to the Fees Office as soon as possible."
How will I be notified of the outcome of my refund/remission application?,"If you are currently enrolled at UWA you will receive an email to your UWA student email address informing you of the outcome of your refund/remission application.
If you are no longer enrolled or have discontinued your studies then you will be notified in writing of the outcome of your refund/remission application via the address provided on your application form."
"I have been granted permanent residency (PR), can I get FEE-HELP?","You are only entitled to FEE-HELP assistance if:

You are one of the following


an Australian citizen who will study at least one unit of your course of study in Australia; or
a New Zealand Special Category Visa (SCV) holder who meets the long term residency requirements and who studies the entire course while living in Australia; or
a permanent humanitarian visa holder; or an eligible former permanent humanitarian visa holder; who studies the entire course while living in Australia



For more information on eligibility see the Study Assist website."
"I have been granted permanent residency (PR), what are my fee options?","Your fee options will depend upon the course of study you are undertaking.

Undergraduate Students
If you are enrolled in an undergraduate degree you will be placed in a Commonwealth Supported Place. These places are subsidised by the Commonwealth Government but they do attract a student contribution payment for the units in which you are enrolled. You must pay your student contribution in full for each unit by the unit census date. Permanent humanitarian visa holders and eligible former permanent humanitarian visa holders can access both a CSP and a HELP loan if they meet the residency requirements.
Postgraduate Students
If you are enrolled in a postgraduate fee-paying place you will now be charged as a domestic student. You must pay your fees in full for each unit by the unit census date.
You are only entitled to FEE-HELP assistance if you are the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa and will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit(s) in which you are enrolled."
I have paid my tuition fees up-front and they do not appear on my Commonwealth Assistance Notice (CAN). What do I do?,"If you have paid your student contribution (tuition fees) up-front but this is not recorded on your CAN, contact the Fees Team via Email Us. Please include all of your payment details in your enquiry.
Also be aware that up-front payments must be made by your unit(s) census date(s). If you make payment after the unit census date it will not be recorded on your CAN.

It is your responsibility to check the census date for each unit in which you are enrolled."
How do I remain eligible for Youth Allowance if I am enrolled as a student?,"Generally, the Centrelink payment Youth Allowance is only paid to eligible students who are studying full-time. This means your aggregate enrolment load must be at least 0.375 Equivalent Full-Time Study Load (EFTSL) in each semester.
Your semester study load is calculated based on your enrolment in standard semester units, combined with any units in non-standard teaching periods. Your study load from non-standard teaching periods will be counted as part of semester 1 or semester 2, depending on the period in which the census date falls. Your combined study load will determine whether you are classified as a full-time or part-time student for a particular semester. Units in summer school are treated as non-standard teaching periods. 
Your enrolment load is reported to Centrelink several times a year and this information is normally used by Centrelink to assess your eligibility for Youth Allowance.

If your semester load changes from full-time to part-time it is strongly recommended you contact Centrelink as soon as possible. If your enrolment load falls below 0.375 EFTSL, you may cease to be eligible for Youth Allowance and may incur over payment or debt.

The UWA Student Guild can provide advice and assistance with Youth Allowance and other Centrelink queries. They can help with applications, appeals and interpreting regulations and policy.   

For further information on Youth Allowance contact Centrelink."
How do I find my unit load or 'student load'?,"EFTSL refers to the Equivalent Full-Time Student Load attributed to a unit. Each unit has a set load (based on the number of credit points that the unit is worth), which is listed on your Statement of Enrolment, electronic Statement of Account (eSOA) and online enrolment on studentConnect. EFTSL is one of the components used to calculate your unit tuition fees or Student Contribution amount. One EFTSL (1.000) is equivalent to a full time student load for one year.
You will find your unit load or student load in studentConnect by clicking on 'Statement of Enrolment' under the COURSE DETAILS menu. This page will provide you with a summary of your enrolment for the current academic year, including your calculated student load (full-time or part-time) for each semester/trimester and the full academic year. Your student load is calculated based on the number of enrolled credit points you have for each teaching period.
You can print your current year Statement of Enrolment by clicking on the ""Statement of Enrolment"" PDF button."
What do I do if my electronic Commonwealth Assistance Notice (eCAN) shows a unit that I have withdrawn from?,"If you believe you withdrew from a unit before the census date, please confirm this by checking your enrolment on studentConnect.

If you withdrew after the census date, you will remain financially liable for that unit."
"I did not re-enrol on time, what should I do?","If you did not re-enrol by the re-enrolment deadline you will normally be required to pay a late fee. If online payment is available, you will be advised to make the payment via studentConnect when you select ""Online Enrolment"" from the left hand COURSE DETAILS menu. Once the transaction has been processed you can re-enrol online within five minutes.

How do I know if I have successfully re-enrolled?,"You can check if you have successfully enrolled by logging on to studentConnect and selecting 'Statement of Enrolment' under the 'COURSE DETAILS' menu.
You can view and print your 'Statement of Enrolment' by clicking on the 'Statement of Enrolment ' PDF icon.
Units that have been added successfully to your enrolment will have a unit status of 'ENROLLED'.  If there are any units with a status of 'INVALID' check the information on how to fix an INVALID unit."
I have enrolled at UWA but now want to accept a different offer. What do I do?,"If you are currently enrolled in a course at UWA and wish to accept an offer for a different course, you will need to withdraw from your current course first. Remember to withdraw before the Census Date to avoid incurring tuition fees. Once you have withdrawn, you can accept your new offer (by the offer expiry date) and enrol.
To withdraw, lodge an application to discontinue your current course online via studentConnect (select 'Discontinuation/Approved Leave' in COURSE DETAILS menu). If you have difficulty lodging an application submit an enquiry via Email Us. You will be notified via your student email account when your application is processed. 
Once your course is discontinued, you will be automatically withdrawn from any enrolled units as of the date you submit your request."
What is the difference between the census date and the academic withdrawal date?,"The Census Date is the last date that you can:

withdraw from units without financial penalty
submit your HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP loan forms and/or make any up front payment for your tuition fees (eligible domestic students only).

The Academic Withdrawal Date after the census date and is the last date that you can withdraw from a unit without academic penalty. The unit will still appear on your academic record as withdrawn (WD) but will not affect your Weighted Average Mark (WAM) or Grade Point Average (GPA).
If you withdraw after the Academic Withdrawal Date you will receive an FN grade (Failure due to non-completion of a unit) on your official Statement of Academic Record, which is equivalent to 'zero' and does affect both your WAM and GPA.
Standard & Non-Standard Teaching Periods
All teaching periods have their own Census Date and Academic Withdrawal Date. The dates for non-standard teaching periods vary from that of standard semesters. To find the specific dates for your units view the Teaching Periods, Census and Withdrawal dates. Please check your enrolment on studentConnect to confirm the teaching periods in which you are enrolled."
Do I need to re-enrol if I'm on approved leave?,"You don't need to re-enrol during a period of Approved Leave. Once your period of Approved Leave expires you must re-enrol or apply for a further period of Approved Leave. If you don't re-enrol or take another period of Approved Leave by the end of week 1 of Semester, your enrolment will be considered lapsed and you may be discontinued from your course. If your course is discontinued you will need to re-apply if you wish to return to study.

Re-enrolment
Re-enrol online via studentConnect during the re-enrolment periods. Log on to studentConnect with your Pheme password and select 'Online Enrolment'. Remember, you can change your enrolment later, within the deadlines, if you need to.
If you wish to apply for another period of Approved Leave, wait until your current leave has expired and then submit a new Approved Leave application on studentConnect (select 'Discontinuation/Approved Leave' in the COURSE DETAILS menu). You can also use this link to check the details of your current Approved Leave period.
If you don't use your Pheme password for 6 months, you may need to reset it on the Pheme website (select the 'Forgotten password' link).
Returning from leave early
If you wish to end your period of leave and return to studies sooner than initially planned, contact us via askUWA for assistance. Depending on the point in the semester/trimester this may or may not be possible, for instance if census date has already passed."
Why do I need to re-enrol?,"It is important to re-enrol each calendar year so the University knows:

You are continuing your course, and
Which units you wish to study

Once you have re-enrolled you can change your unit selection later. Check the Teaching Period dates for when you need to finalise your enrolment for each semester.
If you want to take time away from your studies, you must apply for Approved Leave.
If you miss the re-enrolment deadline, you may need to pay a late fee to re-enrol. If you do not re-enrol by the end of week 1 of Semester, or are not granted Approved Leave, the University will assume you are not returning to study and your enrolment will be discontinued (lapsed). If you wish to return to study, you will need to re-apply for your course.

You will only have access to re-enrol in your current course. If you are an undergraduate student and wish to enrol in a different undergraduate course, you should submit an Undergraduate Transfer Application.
Other students wishing to change course should apply as a new applicant. Refer to the Future Students' website for application details.
You can visit the Current Students website for more information and re-enrolment dates."
What units can I study in Summer School?,"Summer School units are offered intensively from November to February each year, across a small number of Summer School teaching periods, followed by an exam period.
UWA offers a small range of Summer School units, in a variety of disciplines, allowing you to accelerate your course progress, make up for missed or failed units, or spread out your study load. Units offered in Summer School cover the same content and have the same workload as subjects taught in standard semesters.
Current UWA students can enrol in up to two Summer School units (12 credit points). Enrolment for Summer School opens during the formal re-enrolment period via studentConnect, from early November.
External Students
Summer School enrolments are also open to:

Incoming cross-institutional students from other Australian institutions.
Members of the general public via the AccessUWA program (assessed or non-assessed).

Visit our Summer School web page for more information."
Why do I need to have a University student email account?,"As a UWA student, you will automatically be assigned a student email account. This email is provisioned when you accept your offer and activate your account via Pheme, and stays with you until you graduate or until you discontinue your studies at UWA (i.e. withdraw).
You will also use your email as your Uni-ID (studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au and password as set in Pheme) to log into your Student Email as well other applications in Office 365 and some provided by UWA for your use.
Remember:

Your UWA student email account is the University's official means of communicating with you. 
You must check your UWA student email regularly to ensure you don't miss out on any important information such as correspondence and reminders about enrolment, fees, classes, examination, graduations. Library notices and other information will be sent regularly to your student email account.  
University emails will only be sent to your UWA student email account. 
University staff will only respond to emails that you send from your UWA student email account.
You will be able to see Staff in your email system - only communicate with Academic staff you are being taught by or have a working relationship with. You must not use this email to harass or annoy others.
You may see some resources and rooms but not all are available for your use to book. They may, however, be booked by staff on your behalf through other means.

Your student email account allows us to verify your identify (unlike third party email accounts).  When you enrol you sign a 'student declaration' in which you acknowledge that you will check your UWA student email, as well as agreeing to the other policies and procedures at the University. 
Contact the UWA Library or Email Us for more information or if you need assistance with your UWA student email account."
What is a 'course' or a 'unit' at The University of Western Australia?,"Course
A course is a program of study which you must complete in order to qualify for a particular award (e.g. a bachelor degree, diploma or certificate). Course details are published on the University Handbook. Contact your Student Advising Office for more information on course content and requirements. A course normally consists of a number of units.
Unit
A unit is a component of study focused on a particular subject or topic. Units are normally worth 6 credit points and involve 150 hours of student workload (including contact hours, personal study and exams). Some units may be worth more than 6 credit points (e.g. project or dissertation units). Units are normally offered in standard semester periods and some in non-standard teaching periods. All units have a Unit Coordinator, but may be taught by a range of lecturers and tutors.
For more information on courses and units visit the University Handbook and the Glossary of Terms."
Where can I view my Enrolment Record?,"You can view your enrolment record by logging onto studentConnect, going to the COURSE DETAILS menu and selecting 'Course & unit details ' then 'Units'. 
You can also select 'Statement of Enrolment' in the COURSE DETAILS menu to view a statement of your current enrolment (for the current academic year). You will also see the option to view or print a PDF copy.

In the left hand menu under 'PERSONAL DETAILS' click on 'Personal profile'

You will be able to change your Semester address, Home address and Emergency contact details by clicking on 'Edit' and typing in the new information.
If you have any trouble changing your address on studentConnect, you can contact Student Administration for help. You will also be prompted to check your address as part of your annual re-enrolment. This is a good time to ensure your Semester address, Home address and Emergency contact details are correct.
If you are an international student please ensure you include a LOCAL Perth address as your Semester address in your personal details on studentConnect.
Normally, the University will contact you via your student email address, however, please ensure your 'Semester address' is up to date so we can contact you if we have welfare concerns."
What are credit points?,"The University assigns a credit point value to each unit of study. A unit is normally worth six points (with some exceptions). A six point unit normally represents approximately 150 hours of student workload (including contact hours, assessments, personal study and examinations). Credit points are used to measure your course study load. The total number of credit points you have completed assists the University in calculating your course progress and completion.
For more information on the University policy on credit points, please visit the Policies and Procedures website.

Standard Annual Full-time Enrolment
A standard full-time study load normally consists of 48 credit points in one academic year (24 credit points per semester - there are two standard semesters in each academic year).

Part-time Enrolment
For Domestic students part-time enrolment is less than 36 credit points in one academic year (or less than 18 credit points in a semester). If you are considering part-time study you should consult the timetable to see whether the units you need to complete are available at the times you are able to attend.

International students
International student visa holders are normally required to study full-time (normally 48 credit points per year). International students should check their visa conditions and contact their Student Advising Office before changing their study load."
I did not enrol under my full/current name. How do I change it?,"The University needs your full legal name recorded and spelled correctly on your enrolment.

If you need to change the way that your name is recorded, you can Email us a full-colour scan of the original document (at the original size), listed below or provide one of the following original documents in person at Student Administration at Student Central:


Change of Name certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages;


Birth Certificate; or


Current Passport showing your full name


If you are relying on a marriage certificate as proof of legal name change then you will need to supply an additional form of legal photo identification in your new name, such as an Australian driver's licence.
You will also need to surrender your UWA Campus Card, so a new one (with your correct name) can be printed by Student Administration.
Once the University updates your full legal name on our records, you will need to ensure the name under which your USI is registered is the same.  Please update your full legal name on the Australian government USI website.
Once the change has been processed, your new name will appear on studentConnect, your Academic Record and your degree certificate.
Your preferred name, if different to your official legal name, will not be shown on official University documents.

NOTE: normally, the University's Statutes do not allow your names, as they appear on your certificate, to be altered or amended once your award has been conferred."
How do I transfer to a different course?,"You can apply to transfer from one undergraduate bachelors course to another as long as you have not yet met the requirements of your current course.

"Why do I have an INVALID unit, how do I fix it?","If you have an INVALID unit, your Student Advising Office will contact you via your UWA student email account and advise whether you can continue with the unit or if you need to choose a different unit. In the meantime, you can refer to the list below to determine why your unit may be INVALID. If you change your mind and do not want to enrol in the INVALID unit then you can delete the unit from your enrolment via studentConnect.
 
An INVALID unit status, may be due to one of the following reasons:
 
You have not fulfilled the pre-requisite required to study the unit
A unit may have pre-requisite conditions to ensure you have the base level of knowledge required to undertake the unit. If you have not fulfilled the pre-requisite, delete the unit from your enrolment via studentConnect or apply for a rule waiver by completing the online Special Approval form. Some Level 1 units have secondary school subjects as prerequisites (for example, ATAR / WACE Chemistry or equivalent). If you have fulfilled the pre-requisite and provided your secondary school results when applying to UWA, your Student Advising Office will waive the INVALID for you.
 
You are not permitted to take the unit in your current course
Delete the unit from your enrolment via studentConnect, or apply for a rule waiver by completing the online Special Approval form (if you believe you have grounds to take the unit).
 
You need to satisfy other conditions to study the unit
Some units have additional requirements that need to be fulfilled before the INVALID can be waived. For example, students enrolled in coursework dissertation units may need to confirm with their Student Advising Office that they have secured a dissertation supervisor. Students enrolling for the first time in Chinese or Indonesian language units will need to sit a language placement test.
 
Your qualifications are not recorded on studentConnect
Your qualifications may not be recorded on studentConnect if you:

Applied, or intend to apply, for credit or advanced standing, or
Completed the pre-requisite unit/s via approved cross-institutional or exchange study.

You are sitting a deferred exam for the pre-requisite unit
Your Student Advising Office will waive the INVALID once you have passed your deferred exam. If you do not pass your deferred exam, you will need to contact your Student Advising Office for advice.
 
There is a quota (limited number of places) for the unit
Your Student Advising Office will contact you if you have a place in the unit.
 
If the teaching period for your INVALID unit commences, you should:

Attend lectures, laboratories, tutorials and other classes until you have received advice from your Student Advising Office.
Register for classes via the Class Allocation System (CAS)."

Depending on the information you require for your application, you can order a Statement of Academic Record (which includes all of your grades) or a Statement of Qualifications (which has your completion date and expected graduation date) on studentConnect. You can use these documents as proof of your course completion before you formally graduate.
Samples of academic documents are available on the current student website, as well as prices and delivery options."
What letters can I show after my name once I have formally graduated and received my award certificate?,"UWA publishes principles and processes for degree abbreviations. Specific award abbreviations can be found in the handbook, these should only be used once you have formally graduated from your award.
For example, if you have graduated from a Bachelor of Commerce course you can write: BCom W.Aust."
Can I come in to collect my award certificate?,"If you are unable to attend a Graduation Ceremony and wish to have your award conferred in-absentia we will send your certificate to you by Registered Post (within Australia) or DHL Courier (overseas) after it has been conferred.
It's important to check your contact address details are correct in studentConnect when you apply to graduate. If you change address before graduation, please ensure you update this in studentConnect as returned certificates incur a postal fee for re-sending. 
If postage isn't suitable for you, contact the Graduations Team via Email Us to arrange an alternative before your award has been conferred."
Can I get my certificate framed?,"Representatives from a professional photography, framing and DVD service will be available outside Winthrop Hall after your ceremony.
If you are unable to attend a ceremony contact the professional service directly via their website."
Can I get a replacement degree certificate if my certificate has been lost or damaged?,"A replacement award certificate can be issued when your original certificate has been lost, stolen, destroyed, not received or damaged.
If you have simply mislaid your original certificate you should order a True Copy as you are still in possession of the original certificate.
If your certificate has been damaged you are not required to complete a statutory declaration form. In this case, complete the order form and return it with your original certificate.
Complete the attached form and submit it along with your ID via the Email Us option. If you're required to make a payment, you'll be sent a link to make a secure payment online after your order form is received."
Can I get a replacement certificate if I change my gender?,"If you are a graduate from UWA who has undergone a gender reassignment, we are happy to replace your award certificate(s) to reflect your name change.
There won't be a charge for these replacements, simply complete the application form below and submit it to Student Administration, Student Central with your supporting documentation. Details of which supporting documents to provide and how to submit your application can be found on the application form."
Can I get a copy of my degree certificate?,"The University provides you with one original degree certificate upon graduation. Duplicate originals are not permitted but you can obtain certified copies or order a True Copy.
True Copy
You can obtain ONE true copy of your degree certificate. This certificate is in the current style and format of your graduation certificate. Instead of the University's graduation seal it has a true copy stamp that is acceptable on occasions when you do not wish to release your original certificate. To order a True Copy refer to the procedures in the attached form. 
Certified Photocopy
To obtain a certified photocopy you will need to have your original degree certificate. You can obtain a certified copy by asking a suitably qualified person to sign, and therefore certify it. Examples are a Justice of the Peace, a Commissioner of Declarations, or a notary public. You can also get a certified copy by bringing your certificate into Student Administration."
I no longer have access to update my address details via studentConnect. What do I do?,"If you have not accessed studentConnect for a while you may need to reset your Pheme account using your student ID and date of birth. If you have forgotten your password click the link Forgotten your password and follow the instructions to reactivate your account.
It is important you update your address details as this is the address we use to send paper or formal documents to you.
If you have completed your course over 12 months ago, it’s likely your Pheme account has expired. In this case, contact the Graduations Team via Email Us and we'll send you a Change of Address Form to update your details.
For security reasons we do not accept change of address details by phone or email."
How do I change my name on my certificate?,"I haven't graduated yet
If your award has not been conferred (graduated) then update your name on your student record before applications to graduate close: 

If your name is spelt incorrectly, or part of your name needs to be added, deleted or changed: come to Student Central in Student Administration with either your Current Passport showing your full name, Birth Certificate, or Change of Name certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The team will update your name on the spot for you. If you can't come to Student Administration to provide the original documentation, you can send a full colour scan to us via Email Us.
If you are relying on a marriage certificate as proof of legal name change, then you will need to supply an additional form of legal photo identification in your new name, such as an Australian driver's licence.
If your name is missing accents: send the Graduations Team an email via Email Us confirming how your name should appear with accents. Your name will only appear on your certificate with accents.
If your name has incorrect capitalisation, spacing, or hyphens: send the Graduations Team an email via Email Us confirming how your name should appear

It's important to take action as soon as possible, once your award has been conferred, your name can only be changed in limited circumstances. If you have any questions about how your name is displayed or you are concerned you will not be able to submit your documents on time, contact the Graduations Team for advice via Email Us.
 
I have already graduated 
If you have changed your name after graduating from UWA, we can update your name so you can order a Statement of Academic Record and/or Statement of Qualifications in your new name. Your award certificate that has been conferred (graduated) cannot be reissued in a different name. If you have changed your name and undergone a gender reassignment, we can reissue your documents free of charge. For further advice contact the Graduations Team via Email Us on the Community site."

If there are no alternative options for either of the clashing classes, you should contact the unit administrator using the contact details provided in CAS to ask for further assistance. Your CAS unit administrator contact details will be visible in the ""Message"" box which will appear above the available class times when you click on an activity in CAS.
You can also contact the Transition Services team for timetabling assistance by using Email Us or by calling +61 8 6488 7130 or +61 8 6488 6789."
Where do I nominate what class times I want to attend?,"Most units use the Class Allocation System (CAS) system, where students can nominate what class times they want to attend.
If you have a unit that doesn't use CAS, contact your school via the contact message given in CAS for that class. Alternatively you can contact your unit coordinator given in the Handbook 
To register your preferences for specific class times, login to CAS using your Pheme credentials. Once logged in, you will be able to:

Nominate in order of preference, which of the available class dates and times you would prefer to attend, CAS will accept preferences for lectures, tutorials, labs and workshops, etc, when there are multiple date and time options available.
View your allocated classes and get your personal timetable

Check the CAS website for specific dates when you can enter your preferences and view your allocation and associated timetable. You will only be able to select your classes at certain times of the year, e.g. Timetables are usually released one week before semester starts. More information can be found at:

CAS explained
Getting help with your timetable and CAS"
When can I see my class allocations in CAS?,"For semester units, CAS allocations are made and personal timetables released usually 3-4 weeks before semester commences. Allocations are made based on the preferences you entered and are not assigned on a first come, first served basis. If you are enrolled in units prior to allocations being run and have not entered your preferences you will be automatically allocated to classes.
If you enrol after allocations are run you will need to select classes, this is based on a first come, first served basis. Dates vary from semester to semester, refer to the CAS website for specific dates.
After the preference allocation has been processed you can still change your classes in CAS until approximately one week before semester under two conditions:

The unit is still open for editing in CAS
There is space available in a class

Units remain open for approximately two weeks after the semester begins for further adjustments if permitted, check the CAS website for specific dates.

If a class is full, contact your Student Advising Office. This information is available in studentConnect when you log in and also linked on the Current Students web page.
Note: for Summer School units or for non-standard units, there is no preference entry and you will be automatically enrolled in classes within 24 hours or enrolment. Once allocated classes you may change class times subject to availability.
For further information visit:

Nominating what class times to attend
Getting help with your timetable and CAS"
I can't attend the class time I have been allocated in CAS. What should I do?,"If you are a first round TISC offer student or an existing student, you can continue to change the classes you have been allocated in CAS for one week immediately after allocations are processed and again approximately one week before semester starts. You can continue making changes to your classes up until CAS closes (approximately two weeks after semester begins). Check the CAS web page for specific dates. 
To change classes after allocation:

Log in to CAS
In the Enrolments window (left screen pane), select any activity group that has the word 'ADJUST' next to it. A list of available activities for that activity group will display. The activity you are already allocated to will appear with a green 'Allocated' button next to it.
Select the 'Select' button next to the activity you want to attend.
Select 'Close' to acknowledge the successful allocation message. Your allocation is in real-time and your timetable will be updated.

If the classes you can attend are full, contact your school via the contact message given in CAS for that class. Alternatively you can contact your unit coordinator given in the Handbook 
If you need assistance using CAS you can contact UniStart or ask for help in person at one of our libraries across campus."
Could a tutorial be offered earlier/later in the day because I have child care/work commitments?,"If you're having difficulty attending a tutorial due to commitments, discuss the matter with the coordinator of your unit. They will explain your options and determine what can be offered to assist with your commitments outside of University life.  The unit coordinator's contact details are in the Handbook entry for the unit and on LMS."
Am I eligible for discounted Public Transport fares?,"You are eligible for a Tertiary SmartRider concession fare card if you are a full-time student studying at UWA. Part-time students are not entitled to concession fares. Check your studentConnect to see if you are full time by going to the ""Enrolment"" menu then ""Confirmation of Enrolment"".
Note: if you are completing your degree in December and are then commencing further postgraduate studies in the following February you may find the concession will drop off your Smart Rider until your new course commences. If you are unsure about your circumstances check with Transperth directly and they can check your card.
Remember to register your SmartRider card in studentConnect within 7 days of purchase to ensure you are charged the correct concession fare.
More information on obtaining a Tertiary SmartRider can be found on the Transperth website."
How do I access LMS from home?,"To access LMS from home, first you must have an account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to connect to the internet. Once you are online go to LMS and login using your   Uni-ID in the form of studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au. If your Pheme password has expired, you will not be able to log into LMS. To reset an expired Pheme password, visit the Pheme website.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will also be required to access LMS from home. More information about MFA is available via the MFA web page. 
For more information visit the Student LMS Help section of LMS. If your Pheme password is current, you have set up MFA and you are having difficulty logging into LMS, contact the University Library or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
I logged into LMS and there are no units in my LMS. What does this mean?,"LMS units will only appear if:

You are enrolled in the unit. Check this by logging in to studentConnect. You will need to wait at least 24 hours after enrolling before units will begin to appear in your LMS.
The teaching period has commenced. LMS units generally only begin to appear on or shortly after the first day of the semester. This is true for the majority of units, although a small number of Unit Coordinators may release their content early. If the semester has not started, wait until it does before looking for your units in LMS.
There is an LMS entry for this particular unit. Some Unit Coordinators choose not to use LMS for their unit. If the semester has started and an enrolled unit is not showing in your LMS, you can contact your Unit Coordinator for more information.

If you still are unable to see units in LMS you have enrolled in or for further help using LMS visit the Learning online page, contact the University Library for student IT support or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
I have changed my enrolment. How soon can I access my LMS course?,"There may be a delay of up to 24 hours for LMS to recognise your change in enrolment. Also, LMS units generally begin to appear on or after the first day of semester and not before. Please wait the required time before attempting to access your LMS units.
Alternatively, if your enrolled units are not appearing in LMS after semester begins, your Unit Coordinator may have chosen not to use LMS, or may still be putting the finishing touches to the site and has not yet released it for student access. In this case you may wish to contact your Unit Coordinator.

If the above is all correct, try logging into LMS again. If you are still encountering problems logging in, contact the University Library for help or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
What is Pheme?,"Pheme is UWA's access management system. You use your Pheme password, along with your student number, to access a range of online UWA services. This includes the UWA Wi-Fi network Unifi, studentConnect and much more.
Your student email, the Learning Management System (LMS), and some other systems uses Uni-ID, which is the same password but instead of a student number, it uses your email address as the username, i.e. studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au. You must be a currently enrolled student to activate your Pheme account.
Visit Pheme to activate your Pheme account, change your password or to reset your password if you've forgotten it.
Your Pheme password expires every 6 months and you will receive an email prompt to reset it in the weeks prior to expiry. If it has expired, there are multiple ways in which you can change your Pheme password or unlock your Pheme account:

You can follow the forgotten password procedure to reactivate it. You will be asked to answer your challenge questions so make sure the answer you have chosen is unique and memorable for you. Any of the previous 6 password versions will not be accepted.
You can also utilise the multi-factor authentication Self Serve Password Reset tool (MFA SSPR) for identity verification. This is handy as it means you do not need to remember your Pheme challenge questions. 

Once you have updated your Pheme please ensure that your devices, laptops, or desktop are not still trying to communicate with our systems using old passwords by updating your password on them. 
Your Pheme account will expire:

28 days from a course discontinuation date (for courses not completed) and;
12 months from your course completion or conferral date.

If you need help with Pheme, consult the student Pheme help information or contact the Library."
What do I do if I have forgotten my Pheme password?,"If you do not remember your password, you may be able to reset it using the 'Forgotten my password' link, through the 'Students' tab on the Pheme web page. You must know the answers to your challenge questions to complete this process.
If you have also forgotten the answers to your challenge questions, you will need to contact staff in any of the libraries for help either in person or by phone. The Library's phone number can be found on the Library's Contact Us page.
You may also be able to reset your password through a Self Service Password Reset (SSPR), by using multi-factor authentication. This method does not require you to answer challenge questions."
How long will it take to access LMS once I have changed my Pheme password?,"Allow 15 minutes after resetting your password in Pheme before attempting to login to LMS. 
To login to LMS you will need to use your Uni-ID in the form of studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au and your Pheme password.
For Student IT Support contact the University Library or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
I've logged into LMS and get a blank screen. What should I do?,"The Learning Management System (LMS) is optimised for use on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You may wish to use these browsers for accessing the LMS.

I haven't applied to graduate. Is it past the closing date?,"Graduation closing dates are available on the UWA Graduation website. To apply for the next round of ceremonies, log on to studentConnect and go to the Graduation section. If you have any questions about your application you can contact the Graduations Team via Email Us."
What do I need to do if I want to take some time off from my studies?,"If you wish to take time off from your studies, you will need to apply for Approved Leave. You can apply for up to 12 months of Approved Leave at a time.
If you do not complete any units in a given semester or trimester, and don't successfully apply for Approved Leave, you will be considered to have discontinued your course (enrolment lapsed). This means you will need to re-apply to the University if you wish to return to your studies at a later date.
International students
You should contact the International Student Support team to talk about any plans to take time off from your studies as you need to have extenuating or exceptional circumstances for your application to be approved.
Apply for Approved Leave if:

You do not intend to study any units in a calendar year.
You withdraw from all of your units for a calendar year without achieving any results.

Lodging an application
Applications for Approved Leave can be lodged online via studentConnect (select 'Discontinuation/Approved Leave'  under COURSE DETAILS and follow the prompts). Applications can be submitted up until the Academic Withdrawal Date (the final date to withdraw from a unit without academic penalty) for the relevant semester - for details see Important Dates.
Note: Whilst applications can be submitted up until the relevant Academic Withdrawal Date for the teaching period, applications which are made after the Census Date and approved, will result in the student remaining financially liable for any enrolled unit fees and the Student Services and Amenities Fees. In order to avoid any financial penalty, students should lodge an application for Approved Leave prior to the Census Date, where possible.
Re-enrolment
If you are granted Approved Leave you need to make sure that you re-enrol within the stipulated re-enrolment dates or apply for another period of Approved Leave, failure to do so may result in a late fee.
Eligibility
There are many reasons why students take time off from their studies: employment, medical, financial, study, travel and other reasons. You normally don't need to specify a reason to be eligible for Approved Leave, but it is important you consider how Approved Leave will impact your course progression and completion time. A decision on whether to grant Approved Leave will be made by your Student Advising Office.
Please read the University Policy on Student Enrolmentlment and visit the Current Students website for further information on Approved Leave.
For further advice on Approved Leave, submit a query using Email Us."
How do I apply for End-on Honours?,"If you are currently completing or have completed your undergraduate degree at UWA within the last 12 months, you can apply for Honours online via studentConnect by selecting 'Apply for a Course' under ""My useful links"".
Other students can apply via our online application system. For details on 'How to apply', dates and deadlines, visit our Honours page on the Future Students website.
Normally, one of the entry requirments for a place in End-on Honours is that you have successfully completed your current undergraduate degree."
How do I enrol in my Honours course?,"If you have applied for an honours course, have received an offer letter and accepted your place, then you can enrol in your units online via studentConnect.
Honours 'Shell' units
Most students undertaking honours will be automatically enrolled in 'shell' honours units for the first calendar year in which they are enrolled. These units are worth zero credit points and are required for administrative purposes only (students should not attempt to withdraw from these units). They correspond to the course and discipline in which you are undertaking honours. For example: A Bachelor of Arts (Honours) student undertaking Honours in English will be enrolled in: ENGL4700 B.A.Hons.(English and Cultural Studies). After the first calendar year, the 'shell' units will not appear automatically in your enrolment and you will need to select these units when enrolling.
Continuing an Honours course
You must enrol in Semester 1 and 2 units online via your studentConnect. Please refer to the Current Students website for full details on Enrolment and Re-enrolment.
Combined Course Students
Once you have received your offer letter, you can enrol in your units on studentConnect. If you have additional units to complete in your combined course, you must apply for Approved Leave for the duration of the Honours programme.
Concurrent Honours
If you are commencing concurrent Honours as part of an undergraduate bachelor degree, then you do not need to submit an Honours application. You will need to ensure that you enrol in relevant Honours units within your course. 
Concurrent Honours programmes are available for certain courses offered within Architecture, Landscape & Visual Arts; Engineering, Computing & Mathematics; Law; and Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences. If you fall into this category and have not re-enrolled, please refer to the re-enrolment information.
For further queries on your Honours enrolment, select Email Us or contact your Student Advising Office."
Can I take a subject at another university?,"You may be able to complete unit/s at another university and have them credited towards your course at UWA. You can study at an:

Australian institution (including an offshore campus) on an approved cross-institutional arrangement
Overseas institution on an approved Student Exchange or Study Abroad program

Your unit/s must be approved by your Student Advising Office prior to undertaking the study.
On completion of your cross-institutional study you will need to submit a formal Academic Transcript from your host institution to your Student Advising Office so credit can be granted towards your UWA course.
Refer to the Enrolments website and 'I Want To Study A Unit At Another University' for further information on cross institutional study and Student Exchange/Study Abroad, including how to apply and application deadlines.
Note: Students undertaking cross-institutional, student exchange or study abroad units in their final semester may not be able to graduate at the next end-of-semester graduation ceremony (July and December). Students must be able to provide UWA with their official formal academic record with finalised grades by the 'Course Requirements Completed' deadline advised by UWA Graduations.
Some Australian institutions will not have released their final results by that date, and those students will not be able to attend the next end-of-semester graduation ceremony. Students may choose to graduate at the next available monthly in-absentia ceremony, or delay graduation to the following ceremony."
What is a WAM (Weighted Average Mark)?,"Your WAM, or Weighted Average Mark, is a numerical value out of 100 that is calculated based on the mark you have received in each unit. It is the average mark you achieve across the units you have completed in your course. It includes all your unit attempts within a course, and each course you have undertaken will have a different WAM.
Your WAM is reported on your Statement of Academic Record and can be found on your studentConnect by clicking 'Course & Unit' and then 'Progress Status'. Your WAM will only appear on your Statement of Academic Record if you commenced your course from 2005 onwards.
Note on awards with distinction: For postgraduate coursework courses where distinction may be awarded, the WAM displayed in the student management system (Callista), in studentConnect and reported in associated documents such as official academic transcripts, is derived from units completed under that course. This may be different to the WAM calculated to determine eligibility for award of a degree with distinction. If in doubt, check your course rules for details of the calculation method for determining award with distinction.
Note on transferring between courses: Students who transfer between new courses will have their advanced standing awarded as ‘duplicate credit’ and the mark(s) will be counted towards their new course WAM. Students transferring credit from old courses, awarded advanced standing based on previous studies from another institution, or students who are in a postgraduate course will only see the reflected credit points achieved on their record. These marks will not be carried over and are not used to calculate their WAM.
Note on withdrawing from units: If you withdraw from a unit before the academic penalty date, these units will not count towards your WAM. However, if you withdraw after the academic penalty date, a mark of 0 will count towards your WAM.
Every unit has an assigned number of credit points, and for every unit you complete (including fails) you receive a mark and grade. To calculate your WAM, achievable unit points are compared against the mark received.
If you're unsure how a grade has impacted your WAM, get in touch with us.
Please use the UWA Calculator to find your WAM.
Formula used to calculate your WAM:
Your WAM is calculated using these values with the formula:


Example: Jane Smith
First year student, Jane Smith, has completed her first year of economics. Her WAM would be calculated as follows:

= 2453.99
Sum credit points
= ( 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6)
= 42
2453.99 divided by 42
= 58.42
Jane accidentally enrolled into ANHB1101; which she realised after the first week and quickly withdrew, which you can see from the WP. She then enrolled into VISA1051.
You'll notice the calculation for ANHB1101 is struck out; this is because Jane withdrew before the academic penalty date. However, Jane also withdrew from VISA1051, but she did this after the academic penalty date, so while there is no final mark for the unit, she did receive a ‘0’ for her mark value.
So Jane's first year WAM is 58.42"
What is a GPA (Grade Point Average)?,"At UWA your Grade Point Average (GPA) is a simple numerical index that summarises academic performance in a course.
Your GPA is reported on your Statement of Academic Record (academic transcript) and can be found on your studentConnect by clicking 'Course & Unit' and then 'Progress Status'. The GPA will only appear on your Statement of Academic Record if you commenced your course from 2005 onwards.
It includes all your unit attempts within a course, and each course you have undertaken will have a different GPA.
Note on transferring between courses: Students who transfer between new courses will have their advanced standing awarded as ‘duplicate credit’, and the mark(s) will be counted towards a GPA. Students transferring credit from old courses or being awarded advanced standing based on previous studies from another institution (or are in a postgraduate course) will only see the reflected credit points achieved on your record; the marks will not be carried over and are not used to calculate your GPA.
Note on withdrawing from units: If you withdraw from a unit before the academic penalty date, these units will not count towards your GPA. Withdrawing after the academic penalty date will count towards your GPA as a fail grade.
Note on awards with distinction: The GPA displayed in the student management system (Callista), in studentConnect and reported in associated documents such as official academic transcripts, is derived from units completed under that course. This may be different to how a GPA is calculated to determine eligibility for other matters, such as scholarships, fee places, award of degrees with distinction etc. If in doubt, check the course/admission/scholarship rules for details of the relevant calculation methods used.
Please use the UWA Calculator to find your GPA.
Formula used to calculate your GPA:
Every unit you do has an assigned credit value; most have 6 credits points. Each grade you receive for a unit also has a value (please see the table below); for example, a High Distinction has a value of 7.
Your GPA is calculated using these values with the formula as follows:

(a) The GPA calculation includes all attempts at units that are awarded a numeric grade.
(b) Unfinalised results are not included in the calculation.

Johnny enrolled into a broadening unit, ANHB1101. After the first week he realised he didn't want to study that unit and quickly withdrew from it, which you can see from the WP. He then enrolled into VISA1051.
You'll notice the calculation for ANHB1101 is struck out; this is because Johnny withdrew before the Academic Withdrawal Date. However, Johnny also withdrew from VISA1051, but he did this after the Academic Withdrawal Date, so while there is no final mark for the unit, he did receive a ‘0’ for his GPA value.
So, Johnny's first year GPA is 4.14"
Are there any programs where I can meet other first year students?,"The UniMentor program helps new students adjust to university life by providing them with the opportunity to be matched with mentors in the second year of their degree or above, studying the same or a similar course, who can answer any questions new students might have and help them settle in. The program also gives new students the chance to meet and interact with other first year students.
Your mentor will be assigned a small group of new students from the same study area, so getting to know your mentee group is great way to start building your networks at UWA. Through the program you will also have the opportunity to attend a variety of social and networking events and activities where you will be introduced to more new and existing UWA students, outside of your mentee group. You can sign up for a UniMentor.
The UWA Student Guild has over 150 clubs and societies, many of which run welcome events for new students to meet each other and find out about the club during O-week and across semester. Many clubs also elect a ‘Fresher Representative’ in the first few weeks of Uni – a great way for first year students to get involved."
Is there help on campus for me if I have a disability?,"UniAccess - UWA’s Disability Office can assist you if you have a short term or ongoing disability and/or medical condition, which affects your study. The Accessibility Advisors at UniAccess are experienced in assisting students with a broad range of medical, learning, mental health, mobility and sensory conditions as well as those providing care to somebody with a disability during their studies.

I have recently paid my outstanding debt but still cannot re-enrol on studentConnect. What should I do?,"Please allow 5 working days from the date of your payment for your student account to be credited with your payment and removal of the debt (encumbrance) from studentConnect. These are all separate processes and you can re-enrol once they have all been completed.
If you paid:

Less than 5 working days ago - Please be patient, your payment will be processed as soon as possible.
More than 5 working days - Submit an enquiry via Email Us and Student Administration will investigate further.

You can always check your outstanding balance on studentConnect.  However, even if this currently states you have a zero balance this does not mean your encumbrance has been removed."
How do I re-enrol after being excluded?,"If you have a course status of EXCLUDED this means you have lost your place and are not permitted to re-enrol in the course at UWA. You will not have access to re-enrol in the course on studentConnect and will lose access to your UWA Pheme account within 28 days. 
The following re-enrolment options may be available to you, depending on your circumstances:
Apply for a different UWA course
You may be eligible to apply for another course at UWA via the Apply portal. Contact the Admissions team via Email Us for more information. 
Re-apply for admission to your excluded course
If you wish to apply to re-enrol in your excluded course, refer to the Student Enrolment policy and check with your Student Advising Office to see if this is possible and if you are within the time limit for the course.  If you then wish to lodge an application you can do so via the Apply portal."
How do I re-enrol after academic suspension?,"If you are a domestic student and have been suspended from your course, you will normally be able to re-enrol once your period of academic suspension has ended. 
 
If you wish to return to study after your suspension
You can re-enrol online via studentConnect during the re-enrolment period for the coming semester or teaching periods. Normal re-enrolment requirements and deadlines apply. If you have not used your password for 6 months or more, you may need to reset or reactivate it via the Pheme website, to logon to studentConnect.
 
If you don't wish to return to study after your suspension 
Make sure that you apply for Approved Leave before the academic withdrawal date of that semester. If you don't re-enrol or take Approved Leave, you may be discontinued from your course (enrolment lapsed).  If you are discontinued and wish to return to your studies at a later date, you will need to re-apply.
 
International students should contact the International Student Support team for advice via Email Us, for information on returning to study or applying for Approved Leave."

What should I do if I need to see UWA counsellor urgently?,"If you are experiencing severe symptoms or are in crisis you should attend an appointment with your family GP or the campus Medical Centre. A GP can assess your need for counselling and provide you with a Mental Health Care Plan or refer you to crisis services.
The UWA Counselling and Psychological Services are unable to guarantee same day appointments. You can contact the UWA Counselling and Psychological Services through our web page, or by calling us on 6488 2423 to arrange an appointment with a counsellor at the next availability.

If you have a concern and you're not sure if we're the right people to see, you are still encouraged to book an appointment with a counsellor, who can provide work with you to get the support you may need, by the right service for your concerns. 
For more information on the types of concerns the UWA Counselling and Psychological Services provide support for, please visit our web page."
Can I make an appointment with a UWA counsellor for my friend?,"The UWA Counselling and Psychological Services can only work with students who book their own appointments, and consent to having an appointment with one of our counsellors. If you are concerned about a friend or want to help them make an appointment, you could assist them by being supportive and encouraging them to book an appointment with our service.
You may also find it beneficial to access counselling yourself to help support you in dealing with a friend or family member that you are concerned about.
For detailed information on booking an appointment with the UWA Counselling and Psychological Services, please visit our web page."
Are UWA Counselling sessions confidential?,"Your information is maintained in the strictest confidence and our staff of counsellors and psychologists cannot share any information without your permission. The only reason we would ever breach this confidentiality is if we have a strong reason to believe that someone's safety is at risk. In these circumstances we will always try to talk to you about our concerns before we would talk to anyone else on your behalf.
The UWA Counselling and Psychological Services maintains all records in keeping with the Australian Psychological Society standards of professional conduct. These are kept in secure files only accessible to counselling staff."
How do I cancel my appointment with the counsellor?,"You can cancel, reschedule and manage all of your appointments through the dedicated UWA Counselling and Psychological Services web portal, by logging in with your student number email (i.e. 00000000@student.uwa.edu.au) and Pheme password.

Examples of common Alternative Exam Arrangements include students completing their exams in an alternative venue, students being given extra time in their exams or students being permitted to use a computer to complete their exams.

In order to receive alternative examination arrangements, contact UniAccess for an assessment of your needs.
Special Consideration relating to an examination is generally for acute illnesses or situations occurring during an exam or exam period. If you believe your situation requires special consideration you can submit an application with your Advising Student Office."
Can I apply for both Alternative Exams and Special Consideration?,"Generally it is not possible to apply for Special Consideration for examinations for which you have already been granted Alternative Exams Arrangements on the grounds of a medical condition and/or a disability. However, an acute exacerbation of the problem may be considered grounds for a Special Consideration application. For example, if a student who has Alternative Exam Arrangements in place but is too unwell to undertake the exam, may need to apply to defer the exam using the Special Consideration Process."
I have ADHD. Should I let anyone know?,"This is up to you. If you have ADD or ADHD you are entitled to UniAccess services so it is a good idea to discuss this with one of the UniAccess Accessibility Advisors.

What should I do if I miss a tutorial?,"If you have missed a tutorial, contact your tutor as soon as possible to ensure you have not missed any important information, announcements, or assessments.
If you missed your tutorial due to unforeseen circumstances and this is likely to affect your performance in the unit, you can apply for special consideration via your allocated Student Advising Office."
Can I ask questions in a lecture?,"Most lecturers welcome questions at any time but it’s a good idea to check with your lecturer first, they may prefer that you wait until a certain point in the lecture where they stop for questions, or until the end of the lecture. If you're not sure, wait until the end of the lecture and ask then."
How much am I expected to read for a tutorial?,"It's a good idea to ask your tutor or unit coordinator to clarify what is expected as it will differ from class to class. Some tutorials will have essential readings that everyone must read and some will give you a choice.
Your unit outlines, available in the Learning Management System (LMS), will usually include a lecture and tutorial schedule indicating the weekly topics and associated readings.
You should always read any essential readings and be prepared to comment on them in your tutorial. Your comment may just be a query about something that you have not understood, but this still shows your tutor that you have completed the preparation for the class."
How much should I contribute to a tutorial?,"You will gain much more from your tutorials if you have prepared and can contribute to the discussion.
Your tutorial contribution is often assessed as part of the participation component of your units, if you don't say anything, it's very difficult for your tutor to credit you any marks, even if you have done all the readings - so try to get involved where possible.
Usually tutorial prep will involve readings or a series of questions but it is different depending on the unit so make sure you consult your unit LMS page and unit outline to ensure you complete all of the necessary preparation before your tutorials."
Where can I purchase cheap food?,"On Campus
UWA Student Guild members can get discounts on food in the Guild's campus cafes (as well as other businesses around Perth). A variety of commercial food outlets are available inside the Guild Refectory offering a range of cuisines at affordable prices. Check the Guild Facebook page for an update on which food vans are on campus and when.
Independently run Campus Kebab, Subway, Rocket Fuel, Roll'd, Utopia and other outlets are also situated beside the Guild Refectory on the UWA Crawley campus.
Off Campus
The Broadway Fair shopping complex is only a short walk from the Crawley campus and houses many reasonably priced food outlets. There are also a number of food outlets located along Broadway and Hampden Road (between the Nedlands Campus and QEII Campus)."
Where is lost property held?,"Lost property is held in two places on the UWA Crawley Campus:

The Guild Student Centre, ground floor, Guild Village.
The UWA Parking and Security Office, which is located at Carpark 1, not far from the UWA Sports and Recreation Centre. The office is open daily for 24 hours and the telephone number is 6488 3020.

The Parking and Security Office will hold lost items for a few days before forwarding them onto the Guild Student Centre. The Parking and Security Office will require you to complete a theft report which covers both stolen and lost property.
The Guild Student Centre keeps lost items for 8 weeks. Go to the Guild website to report your lost item, visit the Guild Student Centre in person, or call 6488 2295 to check if your item has been handed in."
What religious / spiritual support is there on campus?,"The University welcomes students of all beliefs and denominations. There is a gateway where students and staff can access a range of services and groups which support spiritual life at The University of Western Australia. We ask all students to become familiar with UWA’s commitment towards cultural and religious diversity, and if they choose, to get involved in the myriad of multifaith, multicultural and multilingual initiatives on campus."
Is there a Muslim prayer room on campus?,"UWA has a Muslim prayer room and an active Muslim Students' Association. The prayer room for males and females is located at the Eastern end (river end) of the Winthrop Hall building.

We ask all students to become familiar with UWA’s commitment towards cultural and religious diversity, and get involved in the myriad of multifaith, multicultural and multilingual initiatives on campus. The University also has a Community Calendar (formerly Interfaith Calendar) which details the key dates for the major religious groups on campus.UWA's Student Guild also represents a number of religious and spiritual clubs and societies. View the list."
When is the O-Day Festival?,"Semester 1, 2023
The O-Day Festival is held on the Friday of O-Week (the week before semester starts).
Guild O-Day Festival, one of the largest events organised by the UWA Student Guild for new students, is held on James Oval.

Music, food, giveaways and promotions are all a part of the activities. The day’s festivities usually end with a feature band on the Oak Lawn. All the stalls and action are on James Oval starting at 10:00am.
Make sure you check the UniStart website for your Orientation schedule.
Semester 2, 2023
There is no O-Day Festival in Semester 2, but you can get to know and sign up to various student clubs at the Club Carnival.

How can I settle into my first year of study?,"Starting uni is a big step. You're probably feeling excited, nervous and maybe even a little bit scared. These feelings are typical for new students, whether you have come straight from school or from the work force.
 
Transition Services
Our Transition Services team offers a comprehensive orientation program for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. As part of this program, we can link you to other services and support that help you connect to the UWA community.

You can sign up, be connected with a mentor and get your questions answered even before Semester starts.
 
The Guild
The UWA Student Guild runs a range of orientation and welcome activities, in addition to those run by the 140+ Guild-affiliated clubs and societies. These are a great way to meet new people, settle into uni life, get involved with events and projects, and find a network of support.
 
Studying at UWA
You can find advice on all aspects of studying at university from STUDYSmarter. There are online services, workshops and study advisers to help you throughout first year and beyond. The UWA Library also have a number of helpful resources and services available to assist you with your studies."

Your enrolled units will become available in LMS in the week prior to the commencement of Semester.
Information on essential textbooks will also be made available on the Essential Textbooks website. This website is updated regularly in the lead up to semester, so you may need to check it more than once.
It is recommended you purchase essential textbooks for convenience due to the frequency with which you will be required to interact with the content. A limited number of textbooks will be made available from the Library in print and will also be made available online wherever possible.
You can purchase textbooks from your choice of vendor to secure the best deal. The Student Guild can provide you with assistance on where to purchase books if required. Books can also be purchased new and second hand at the Guild Bookshop (second floor, Guild Village), which is located on campus."
Does anyone run study groups on campus?,"There are no formal study groups on campus, but there are often informal study groups run by a number of School specific societies within the UWA Student Guild.
If you'd like to find out about study groups in your discipline, get in touch with the relevant Guild society."
What happens if I arrive late and miss Orientation?,"If you are arriving late, it might be a good idea to request a UniMentor. A UniMentor is a current student from your school who will be able to show you around the campus and help you settle into life at UWA.
Visit the UniMentor Help Tent opposite the Guild Student centre during Week 1, this is where you can pick up important resources you may have missed out on during Orientation. The Help Tent provides help and support for students during the initial weeks of uni, with information about various student services, help with physical directions to venues and any other general questions.
You can also access the 'Your Orientation' organisation within the Learning Management System (LMS) to access all the recordings from Orientation.
If you missed the formal orientation activities, you should also get in touch with your Student Advising Office to get up to speed on any course-specific information.
The university also offers lots of exciting optional activities throughout the first six weeks of each semester as part of the UWA Connect program so be sure to check out the final page of the UniStart website and keep an eye on your student email for information about these activities and events."

What does Alternative Exit mean?,"Alternative Exit means that you have chosen to graduate from an award which is different from the award associated with your postgraduate course; or you have chosen to graduate from only one of the awards in a combined course.
Alternative Exit for Postgraduate Courses
For example, if you do not wish to complete the Master of Oil and Gas Engineering course and you have completed the requirements for a lesser qualification in accordance of the course rules you may apply to the School to exit with the approved course. The course rules will state if it is possible for you to graduate with a lesser qualification i.e. a graduate diploma or a graduate certificate instead of a Master degree. Submit your Alternative Exit Form to your Student Advising Office.
Alternative Exit for Combined Courses
For example, if you are enrolled on a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Commerce combined degree but you wish to graduate only with a Bachelor of Commerce you can fill in an Alternative Exit Form and submit it to both Science and Arts, Business, Law and Education for approval. Once the form is approved and processed you will be able to graduate with a Bachelor of Commerce (as long as you have completed all the course requirements for that course).
If you're unsure of your options, have a chat to your Student Advising Office to see what's possible, and complete the form below."
I am enrolled in a combined course and I have completed the course requirements for one of my courses; can I graduate with that award before completing the combined course?,"If you are enrolled in a combined course you cannot graduate from one component of your course (even if you have already completed it) until you complete all of the course requirements for your combined degree.
This means, if you wish to graduate from your combined course and receive all your degrees, you must wait until you have completed all courses that are part of your combined degree.
If you do not intend to complete your combined course and want to graduate from the course you have already completed, you can apply for an Alternative Exit.
To find out more about Alternative Exits, refer to the University Rules in the UWA Handbook.
To apply for an Alternative Exit from your course download the Alternative Exit - Combined Courses Only form.
Note: If you apply for an Alternative Exit, you will not be permitted to re-enrol in your combined course to finish the other degree/s."
I do not wish to complete my course. How do I take out a lesser qualification?,"If you do not wish to complete your course and want to take out a lesser qualification, it's important you contact your Student Advising Office to discuss whether you are eligible to take an Alternative Exit.
To apply for an Alternative Exit, download the correct Alternative Exit form below and submit it to your Student Advising Office.
Conditions apply when taking out an alternative exit. This means that should you decide to come back and complete the higher award (provided the course rules and availability allow it), your lesser award will need to be surrendered first."

What is Orientation?","Orientation (O-Week) is held on campus the week before classes start each semester.

All students will have important core activities to attend as well as a number of optional activities available. Details about these event can be found on the UniStart website under the section 'Orientation'.

One of the most important events in O-Week is your Welcome Ceremony, which is your official induction to the University. You can find out more about this event on the UniStart website.
O-Week also includes activities specific to your School which are compulsory to attend. As part of your School activities you will have the opportunity to meet other students and staff from within your study area and learn your way around the UWA Campus. There are also many non-course-specific activities planned throughout the week which are highly recommended.
In Semester 1, the Friday of O-Week is the Guild O-Day Festival. This is a great opportunity to sign up to clubs and societies. James Oval is a hive of activity with Guild Clubs and School Societies, sporting groups, and other community groups providing information and displays about what's available for students. Music and food, giveaways and promotions add to the festival atmosphere. There is no Guild O-day in Semester 2 however you will still have opportunities to sign up for various clubs during semester.
Check the UniStart website to find out more about O-Week."

What happens if I breach the UWA land by-laws?,"Your parking permit may be suspended if the vehicle, for which you have a parking permit, is found breaching the University By-Laws."
How much are the parking fines?,"In accordance with The University Lands By-Laws, the following parking infringements may be issued.

Note: If the infringement is paid within 7 days, the infringement may be reduced by $10.  The discount does not apply if the infringement is appealed.

The penalty for infringements is set at a community standard. The values of the penalty at The University of Western Australia are set by The University of Western Australia Senate. Parking regulations must be obeyed in order to maximise parking options for the many groups of people (commuters, students, school staff, visitors, etc.) who need parking space. Anyone who disregards the parking regulations tramples on the rights of others to park in their assigned area. The infringements are expensive, but it is an expense which is completely avoidable. All you need to do is be aware of and comply with the rules.

The University is authorised to impose modified penalties for parking infringements and uses the Fines Enforcement Registry system for fine enforcement.  Parking infringements, which are not paid within 7 days, enter the fine enforcement cycle and non payment will attract additional fees."
How do I borrow items from one of the libraries?,"UWA Campus Card holders may check items out via self-check machines in libraries or by staff at the Information Desk. Your UWA Campus Card is your borrowing card. Staff in the libraries can assist you to locate material as needed.

How do I know when my loans are due back?,"Log into My Library Account to check when your loans are due. Due dates are also listed on checkout receipts when you borrow via self check machines.
Your loans may be requested by another borrower at any time and this may change the due date. For UWA students, the University Library sends change of due date notices to your UWA student email account and via SMS to your phone. UWA staff receive notices via their UWA staff email account. All other borrowers receive notices via the email address provided when obtaining membership."
How do I renew my loans online?,"You can renew your loans by logging into My Library Account.
Loans can be renewed as long as they are not requested by another user. You can also renew your loans in person or over the phone by visiting or contacting your Library.
More information about borrowing is available online."
Can I request books and other physical items from the Library?,"There are a number of request options available to University Library members, including requesting items on the shelf and items on loan. Sign into OneSearch to see your requesting options for individual items.
Where can I pick up my requested item?
When requesting physical items (loans) from the UWA collection or through Get It, there are a number of different delivery options depending on your user group.

For most students you will need to nominate one of the UWA Libraries as your collection point.
For staff based on campus or in the metro area, you have the additional option to request items to be sent to your work/office address. This will add 1 to 2 days to the delivery time.
For regional postgraduate students and staff, you have the option to request items to be sent to your home address via Express Post. This will usually take 2 to 3 days if the item is available.
For Albany undergraduate students, you will need to select Albany Campus as a pickup location. Items will be sent to the Albany Campus for you to collect. This will usually take 2 to 3 days if the item is available. Once the item is ready for collection, you will receive an email notification.

Affiliate (including alumni), Community, and Reciprocal members are unable to request items that are held on-site. Items that are located in offsite storage can be requested using the store requests form.
Where you have nominated a physical location of either the UWA Library or the Albany Centre, you will get an email when your request is ready for collection.
 
How long will my request take?

If you request a book that is on loan, the request may take a week or more as the item will need to be returned by the borrower who has the item.
If you request a book that is on the shelf, the item is collected overnight and placed on the hold shelf for you the next day.
If you request a book to be moved from one library to another library this may take 1 to 2 days to go through the UWA mail system before being placed on the hold shelf for you.
Requested items on the hold shelf are held for 4 days. If you are unable to pick up your requested item in time please contact the Library, as we may be able to extend the pickup period. If another user has also requested the item, your loan will be restricted to 3 days to allow equitable access to the item.

Note: there can be delivery delays if requested items can’t be located immediately when requested or need to be transferred between library locations. You will be notified when your item is ready for pickup and you can check your request progress in My Library Account."
"What are the borrowing notices from the University Library, and how do I receive them?","The University Library sends email notices to UWA staff and students via their official UWA email account. All other members receive notices via the email address provided when obtaining membership.

Is there a penalty if I return loans late to the Library?,"Details on when penalties apply and how much you may be fined are listed on the Borrow web page.
If you have an overdue loan, your borrowing privileges will be suspended until the loan is returned. If your unpaid fines total $24 or more, your borrowing privileges will remain suspended until the fine is paid in full. In addition, if you are a UWA student, a debt will be recorded as an Administrative Encumbrance on your student record, which will prevent access to examination results, transcripts, graduation and re-enrolment. This encumbrance will be removed once the total fine has been paid in full. You will still be able to borrow normally if your fine is less than $24.
If you have a loan that is a month or more overdue, you will be requested to pay a replacement fee for the item. This charge will be waived, or refunded within 12 months of payment, if the item is returned."
How do I pay my library fine?,"You can pay your fine by EFTPOS in person or over the phone at the Reid, Barry J. Marshall or J Robin Warren libraries. While cheques are accepted, cash is not.
Current UWA students and staff can also pay fines online via My Library Account. Visa and MasterCard are accepted.

After you have selected a job to print, your document is sent to a queue accessible from all of our multi-function printers (MFPs) that are connected to the global print queue (only you will be able to see and retrieve your printing). Your print job only prints once you have tagged your UWA Campus Card on a MFP. Your print job will be held for up to 12 hours in the secure global queue before it is deleted.

Note: for best results, we recommend only selecting one print job at a time at the MFP. Using the 'select all' function can result in lengthy delays. Please see our how to print guide for other handy tips.
Pay for photocopying and printing using your UWA Campus Card. It costs 5c per A4 page to photocopy or print in black and white. There are additional charges for colour photocopying and larger formats.
You can use the autoloader machines in the libraries to add money to your card. Autoloaders accept EFTPOS and credit cards.
You may also add printing and copying credit to your UWA Campus Card online. Log in with your Pheme details. Make sure your pop-ups are enabled. Use your Visa or Mastercard credit or debit card to add credit.

Within an assignment, you will need to provide a shortened in-text reference at the point at which you refer to a specific source. This pairs with the full end-text reference list your readers can use to locate the source. Different referencing styles have different requirements – for instance, some use author and date while others use footnote numbers for in-text references. See our Referencing at UWA Guide for an introduction to these principles of referencing and to different styles.
 
Your Unit Coordinator will nominate a style of referencing for you to follow. This information is often found in the unit outline in the Learning Management System (LMS) or within the assignment information. Once you know the referencing style you need to use, refer to the specific UWA referencing guide for that style for examples of how to reference the different format source types you use.

 
For direct help, Email Us, use our Live Chat, or book an online consultation with a librarian via the Book a Librarian service.   
 
See Library contacts for more details about visiting our library and using our support services."
What is EndNote and how can it help me?,"EndNote is a referencing software that enables you to create a library of references based on information resources you are referring to. Your library of references can then be organised, edited and converted into a formatted bibliography in the referencing style required for your assignment or thesis. EndNote can be used together with MS Word to cite your references as you write, and create your full list of references used.
 
EndNote is free for UWA staff and students and can be downloaded for use on a personal device such as a laptop or home computer. The University Library produces an EndNote self-help guide which includes an online learning path designed to step you through how to use EndNote. Support for EndNote can be found in the following guide"
How do I get help using EndNote?,"The University Library produces an EndNote self-help guide which includes an online learning path designed to step you through how to use EndNote.

How do I get a receipt of payment for my Student Services and Amenities Fee?,"To view and print your receipts of payments click on ""Received Payments"" under the Finance Option in your studentConnect. Click on the PDF icon in the Payment Receipt column.
Note: Bank and Credit Card payments may take up to 2-5 working days to be processed."
"I am a Unit Coordinator, how do I add new material to my Unit Readings list?","The Unit Readings FAQs provide details on how to add Library and online resources to a reading list for your students.
For further assistance and troubleshooting please contact the Library."
How much can I copy from a book or journal article for research and study?,"For books, journal articles and notated music the Copyright Act deems it 'fair' to copy a reasonable portion for the purposes of research or study. A reasonable portion is considered to be:

an article in a periodical publication (e.g. one journal or newspaper article)
more than one article from a periodical publication if it is for the same course of study or research
10% or one chapter if the work is a published edition of 10 pages or more; or 10% of the words if the work is in electronic form.

To copy more than this amount, or to copy from works other than those listed above (that is, artworks, audiovisual material or from the internet) you must consider whether the use would be considered fair. If the amount you have used or copied could be recognised by the creator as something unique in their original work (even if it is a couple of bars of music or a small detail of a painting), then generally this is considered a ""substantial"" part so you cannot use it without the creator's permission. You must also abide by the terms of use associated with online sources (for example, the website's terms of use). You should always acknowledge the source of the material through a reference.
See the Copyright at UWA webpage for more information."
Can I copy copyright material if I am a student?,"Under the fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act, you can reproduce copyright material without permission provided it is for the purposes of:

research or study
criticism or review
parody or satire

And providing your use of the material is 'fair'. 
For books, journal articles and notated music the Copyright Act considers it 'fair' to copy a reasonable portion, which is defined as:

an article in a periodical publication (e.g. a journal or newspaper article)
more than one article from a periodical publication if it is for the same course of study or research
10% or one chapter if the work is a published edition of 10 pages or more; or 10% of the words if the work is in electronic form.

When deciding whether to copy more than this amount, or if you are copying an artistic work (such as an image or photograph) or audiovisual material (such as a sound recording, film or TV program), you must consider whether your use would be considered 'fair'. To decide whether your use is fair, consider the following factors:

the purpose and character of your use
the nature of the work
the possibility of obtaining the work within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price
the effect of the dealing upon the potential market for, or value of, the work
the amount and substantiality of the part copied taken in relation to the whole work.

See the Copyright at UWA webpage for more information."
What are the limits for copying for criticism and review?,"There are provisions in the Copyright Act that allow literary, dramatic, musical, artistic or audiovisual works to be copied for the purposes of criticism or review, providing the work is acknowledged through a citation and providing the use of the work is 'fair'.
When determining whether your use of a work is 'fair', consider the following:

it must be a genuine attempt to review and/or critique the work (e.g. comparing the work with another work by the author; comparing one movie clip with another as part of a film review)
the criticism may be of the underlying ideas in the work, or the work itself
criticisms and reviews do not need to be balanced and can be humorous.

Note: You cannot rely on this provision to use a work simply to explain or illustrate your own work. When you copy a work for criticism or review (or for any other purpose), you must acknowledge the creator and details of the work in a reference.
See the Copyright at UWA webpage for more information."
How long does copyright last for?,"Copyright does not last forever and different rules apply to different types of work. Generally, material can be used without seeking permission once the copyright has expired.
The table below is a guide to some duration rules and applies to works made before 1 January 2019. For works made after 1 January 2019, and for more detailed information on copyright duration, see the Australian Copyright Council's information sheet on the Duration of Copyright.



 Type of Work
 Duration


 General rule for published works
 Life of author + 70 years


 Film & sound recordings
 Year first published + 70 years

In Australia, there is no register of copyright material and no list of what material is in the “public domain” (i.e. out of copyright). Sometimes you will need to do some detective work to determine whether something is still protected by copyright.  
If you're unsure of the copyright status of a work that you'd like to you, please contact the University Library for assistance."
How do I find and access UWA theses?,"For access to any UWA Thesis, first check the UWA Profiles and Research Repository for a digital version. If there isn't a digital version available in the Repository then you can also check OneSearch for a printed and/or digital version.
 
UWA Library holds print copies of most pre-2017 UWA Masters and Doctoral (PhD) theses. If you are able to sign in to OneSearch then you can make a request to consult a printed thesis within the Reid Library. Non-UWA users will need to complete a Store Request Form.
 
History Honours theses and Law Honours theses can also be located and requested using OneSearch. All other Honours dissertations and Masters by coursework are not held by the University Library, but may be held by the relevant UWA School. Please contact the appropriate UWA School for more information.
 
Libraries, Institutions and individuals outside UWA may inquire about purchasing scanned copies of UWA Theses for research purposes."
How can I obtain a copy of a non-UWA thesis?,"First check the Theses page for information on how to locate a non-UWA Thesis. If the full-text is not available through the resources listed on this page, UWA staff and postgraduate students can request a copy of a non-UWA thesis through Get It.
If you need further assistance, please contact the University Library staff in your Library."
What is the UWA Profiles and Research Repository?,"The UWA Profiles and Research Repository is an open platform that provides comprehensive and current information about all aspects of the research and teaching activities of UWA researchers, enabling the dissemination of research outputs, activities and achievements to potential researchers, students, industry partners and the wider community.
The UWA Profiles and Research Repository supports the University's strategic goal to be a global leader in internationally renowned research by communicating high quality, freely available UWA research publications to a broad worldwide audience. It also supports UWA researchers to comply with Open Access mandates and the University's Excellence in Research Australia (ERA) submission.
Profiles in the Repository are the sole, authorised public profiles for UWA researchers. Current Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students can request a profile in the UWA Profiles and Research Repository.
Postgraduate research students who commenced their candidature after March 2003 are required to lodge an electronic copy of their Thesis with the Repository as part of their final submission process. 

More information is available on the UWA Profiles and Research Repository Support guide."
What is CAS?,"CAS is UWA's Class Allocation System, this is where you:

Enter your class preferences for tutorials, laboratories, lectures, seminars and workshops 
Once preferences have been allocated you can view and edit your classes and view your personal timetable

Preferences


When selecting preferences for each class, you will need to nominate what day and time you prefer in order of priority (1 = your first preference; 2 = your second preference; etc.) for each unit.


Some classes may have lots of times to choose from, some classes may only have one option to choose from. You may be required to enter at least 4 preferences.

You will have approximately 4-6 weeks to enter and edit your preferences. If you do not enter preferences you will automatically be allocated class times by CAS.

Allocations


Approximately 3-4 weeks before semester starts you will be allocated your classes and be able to view your timetable. Allocations are made based on the preferences you enter and are NOT allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis.

First round TISC offer students and existing students may adjust their allocated classes for a period of one week immediately after the allocation has run and again approximately one week prior to semester. Check the CAS website for specific dates. 

CAS Tips

You may only enter your preferences and view your allocations at certain times of the year. Consult the CAS website for specific dates.
You must first be enrolled in at least one unit for the unit to appear in CAS. If you un-enrol from a unit it will disappear in CAS but this does not affect your academic standing. Use studentConnect to add units to your enrolment. It may take up to 1 hour after enrolment for a unit to appear in CAS.
CAS may not display correctly in older browsers (like Internet Explorer). We recommend that you update to a more recent version if you are having difficulty, or use a computer in one of our libraries.
If the only classes you can attend are full you can send a SWAP request for the full class. CAS will process the request instantly if there is an available spot. If not, your request will  be in pending queue.
For any enquiries please contact your school via the contact message given in CAS for that class. Alternatively you can contact your unit coordinator given in the Handbook  You can also contact the Transition Services team for assistance with your timetable by emailing  transition@uwa.edu.au or Email Us.

If you need further assistance, there are drop-in help sessions for new students during Orientation week (O-Week) - check the UniStart website for dates and times or you can ask staff for help in person at one of our libraries across campus.

What is the difference between CAS and studentConnect?,"studentConnect is where you can manage your enrolment and other matters such as:

Updating your address and contact information
Enrolling and re-enrolling
Viewing your current enrolment and study plan
Viewing your exam timetable and checking your unit results
Checking your course tuition and administration fees including HECS
Registering your SmartRider or applying for a parking permit
Checking your graduation information and ordering academic statements

You must first be enrolled in a unit in studentConnect for it to appear in CAS.
Class Allocation System (CAS) is where you enter your preferences for class times within your enrolled units and can view your personal timetable once it's allocated. Changes you make in CAS do not affect your enrolment but any changes made in studentConnect will affect what appears in CAS.
For more information visit:

CAS explained"
How do I choose my classes if CAS won't let me enter preferences?,"There may be a number of reasons why you can't enter preferences in CAS:

CAS may not be open for entering preferences: You can only enter preferences at specific times of the year. Check the CAS website for relevant dates.
Not all units use CAS for entering preferences or allocating students to class times, or the unit coordinator may have disabled it for a specific reason. Further information will be provided by CAS in this case.
Your unit is a Summer School or non-standard unit.  After enrolling you will be automatically allocated class times within 24 hours. Once allocated you may then make changes to your classes subject to availability. 
You can get into the unit in CAS but there aren't any options available because there are no remaining spaces: In this situation it is best to contact your unit coordinator who may have a specific reason for configuring their units in this way. Only your unit coordinator will be able to make changes to units in CAS in this scenario.

You can add minors to your degree by going to studentConnect > Course Details > Online Enrolment > Unit sets and adding your desired minor.
Note: minors can only overlap with your other unit sets (major or minor) by a maximum of ONE unit to be eligible for it to be recognised on your degree certificate and academic documents. For example: the English Literary Studies major and Creative Writing minor have four units in common. A student wishing to complete both units sets would simply select other units in the major to ensure that only a maximum of ONE unit overlapped with the minor.
More information about minors and the Undergraduate Degree Course Structure can be found online in UWA Handbooks."
Can I do a triple major in my undergraduate degree?,"A standard major comprises of 8 to 12 units, and extended major comprises of more that 12 units.
In a comprehensive Bachelors degree, such as the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Biomedical Science and Bachelor of Commerce, the course is designed so that students can complete two majors. In some instances, and with careful planning, students in these degrees may be able to complete up to three majors.
Completing a third major is only permitted where all degree and major requirements are met and can be completed within the standard degree space of of 144 credit points (typically 24 x 6-point units). 
Students who are unable to fit an entire third major into their course plan, may consider taking a minor. 
2022:
Undergraduate students wanting to study a language major alongside their current Bachelor degree can apply to study a concurrent course Diploma in Modern Languages.
The Diploma in Modern Lanuages is not available for any future intakes.

2023:
From 2023 the Diploma in Modern Languages will be replaced by the Bachelor of Modern Languages, available as a combined-degree option."
Do I have to complete all my Level 1 units before starting Level 2?,"This answer applies to undergraduate / bachelor degree students.
There is no set number of Level 1 units you must complete before enrolling in Level 2 and Level 3 units.
You can enrol in an undergraduate unit (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3) if you meet its prerequisites. Search the Unit Details section in UWA Handbooks for information on unit prerequisites. For example: The unit CLAN2001 The Golden Age of Athens has the prerequisite ""any Level 1 CLAN unit"".
It is recommended that you enrol in only Level 1 units in your first semester of study, regardless of unit prerequisites."
What jobs can I get with an Arts degree?,"Studying an Arts degree will allow you to develop skills that are highly sought after by employers such as clear written and oral communication skills, critical and analytical thinking, creative decision making skills, logical reasoning, and independent, resourceful and reflective problem-solving abilities.
Arts courses include opportunities to travel overseas to broaden your studies, experience and cultural competence. You can also enrol in Work Integrated Learning or McCusker Centre for Citizenship internship to gain valuable workplace experience. The knowledge and skills you acquire, whichever degree you choose, will equip you for success in your future life and career.
Many of our alumni have achieved esteemed careers in politics and foreign affairs and amongst our graduates we have a prime minister, several premiers and a number of ambassadors. It is reassuring to see how many Arts graduates have reached the pinnacle of their companies and work as managing directors and chief executive officers. Others have taken advantage of the WA resources industry and work as archaeologists, anthropologists, heritage officers, historians and communications officers with mining and associated companies. Graduates are also employed in the media, public service, education and non-for-profit organisations.
Explore the many careers available to graduates on the Future Students and the Careers Centre website.

You can also visit current news stories from Arts and culture to get an idea of what we're up to."
Where are the Arts Lecture Rooms and Lecture Theatres located?,"The Arts Building is located off Hackett Drive Entrance No 1 on the UWA Crawley campus.
Lecture Rooms are located on the south-side, facing Carpark 3 near the Reid Library.
Arts Lecture Rooms 4, 5, and 6 are on the ground floor.
Arts Lecture Rooms 8, 9 and 10 are on the first floor.
Lecture Theatres are located on the west-side, also near Reid Library and the Great Court.
Alexander Lecture Theatre, Fox Lecture Theatre and Murdoch Lecture Theatre are on the ground floor.
Austin Lecture Theatre is on the first floor.
Maps of the Arts Building and room numbers are generally pinned up near staircases and elevators within the building."
Can I increase or reduce my study load?,"In UWA courses a standard full-time enrolment is 24 credit points (4 units) per semester, or 48 credit points (8 units) per academic year.
International students need to maintain a standard full-time study load per semester to satisfy student visa requirements. If you are an international student and need to take leave or reduce your study load, please contact the International Student Support team for advice.
Australian and other domestic students can choose to enrol part-time or full-time. In studentConnect your student status is determined by the number of credit points enrolled in over an academic year.
For Australian domestic students:

24 points / 4 units per semester  =   standard full-time (100% study load)
18 points / 3 units per semester  =   full-time (75% study load)
12 points / 2 units per semester  =   part-time (50% study load)
  6 points / 1 unit per semester   =   part-time (25% study load)

A reduced study load could mean that a course will take longer to complete. Courses need to be completed within course time limits. For example, a Bachelor of Arts (BP001) which is typically completed in 3 years via standard full-time enrolment, has a course time limit of 10 years.
A reduced study load may affect Student Income Support entitlements such as Youth Allowance, Austudy, and Abstudy.
At certain times during the semester: withdrawing from units will incur an academic penalty and/or financial liability. Consult UWA important dates, or contact your Advising Student Office for information.
Overloading is only permitted in limited circumstances. Students can apply to overload by submitting an online Special Approval form."
"I've been offered a place in an bachelor degree as a first year student, can I defer for a year?","Deferral is an authorised 'gap year' between being offered a place at UWA and commencing studies in the offered course.

New students can choose to defer studies at the time of accepting their offer through TISC

Where new students have already accepted their place at UWA:

Students who withdraw or become discontinued / lapsed can apply for admission at a later date
Students who have completed at least 6 points of their course can apply for Approved Leave
Generally, students who have not completed at least 6 points in their course cannot apply for Approved Leave. Instead these students need to withdraw from their course and apply for the same course during future intake periods

Where deferral is not an option (ie. audition-entry Music programs, Honours and most postgraduate programs, and offers with an unmet Admission condition) students may 'decline' their offer or 'withdraw' from their course. Students are welcome to apply for the same course during future intake periods."
What majors can I complete in my Arts degree?,The list of majors offered in the Bachelor of Arts (BP001) can be found in the Handbook.
Where can I find my timetable?,"Organising your timetable is your responsibility at UWA. Once you have enrolled in your units, you will use the Class Allocation System (CAS) to choose your classes and create your timetable. Watch the videos and read through the resources on the CAS website for instructions on how to register for classes in CAS. 
Note: You will need to wait one hour after completing your enrolment before logging in to CAS as the system takes time to register your enrolment.
If you require further assistance with your timetable, you can submit an enquiry via Email Us and a staff member will assist you."
What is a Property Condition Report?,"The Property Condition Report outlines the contents and condition of the property at the beginning of the tenancy. It can indicate anything that is broken or in poor condition, (e.g. cracked sink in the bathroom; stained carpet in bedroom two; broken light fitting in kitchen etc.).
Both the tenant and the landlord or their agent should sign the completed property condition report.
If you are a boarder/lodger we suggest you compile a Property Condition Report to protect yourself. If the owner or agent won't sign the document, you can ask someone else to sign it; this must be someone who has seen any damage as listed. Photographs of the damage will help support your claims of any damage.
You should keep a copy of the Property Condition Report as this report can help you avoid any potential conflict at the end of a tenancy.
Information and advice about the Property Condition Report can be obtained from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety: Tel: 1300 304 054"
How do I re-enrol?,"If you are a current student intending to study in the next calendar year, you must re-enrol online via studentConnect within the re-enrolment period.

Log on to studentConnect
Go to the COURSE DETAILS menu
Select ""Online Enrolment""
Select ""Begin online enrolment""

Visit the Current Students' website for important re-enrolment information, including re-enrolment dates and late fees.

Enrol for the academic year
It is recommended you re-enrol for the entire academic year (Semester 1 and Semester 2) prior to receiving your results.
If you have been granted deferred or supplementary examinations you must still re-enrol, even though you have not completed the examinations. Remember, you can change your enrolment once you have re-enrolled.
If you would like further advice on your study plan please contact your Student Advising Office or consult the UWA Handbook for specific information relating to your course and units.

Higher Degree by Research Students
The way you re-enrol depends on the type of research degree you are studying.
Not studying in the next calendar year
If you don't wish to study in the next calendar year  or intend on taking some time away from your studies, you must apply for Approved Leave. If you don't re-enrol or take Approved Leave your enrolment will be discontinued (lapsed). Remember, you can change your Approved Leave later, if you change your mind.
Difficulty enrolling?
If you experience any difficulty enrolling (including error messages) check the common reasons that you may not be able to enrol online. If you are still experiencing difficulties please contact your Student Advising Office or Student Administration and we will investigate for you."
When is the academic withdrawal date?,"The Academic Withdrawal Date is the last date to withdraw from a unit without academic penalty.
Withdraw by this date to avoid an   'FN' grade.  Failure due to Non-completion of a unit) on your academic record. An FN grade is equivalent to a mark of 'zero' and does affect your Grade Point Average (GPA) and Weighted Average Mark (WAM ).
If you withdraw by the Academic Withdrawal Date you will receive a WD (Withdrawn without academic penalty), which will appear on your formal Academic Record.
Note: you cannot make changes to your enrolment online on studentConnect after the Census Date for your unit/s. After the Census Date you must request a manual 'Change of Enrolment' form from your Student Advising Office or Student Administration.
For more information on the important dates for your units, including the Academic Withdrawal Date, please see the Teaching periods, census and withdrawal dates published on the Current Students website."
Where can I find past exam papers?,"Past exam papers can be accessed through OneSearch and can be searched by keyword or Unit Code. For example you could search for ""accounting"", ""ACCT2203"", or ""ACCT*"" to retrieve relevant examination papers. 

Not all units will have past exam papers available. Only papers lodged with the Examinations Office by Unit Coordinators as available for publication can be accessed in OneSearch and some units do not publish their past exam papers at all. 

Exam papers will be made available online once all supplementary and deferred examinations for that semester have been completed. Supplementary and deferred examinations take place approximately two months after the end of the standard examination period."

Your home university if UWA has an agreement with them where tuition and other fees are invoiced to your home university
The Education Abroad Network (TEAN)

Your original academic transcript (or a certified copy)
Evidence of English language competency (where appropriate)
A colour copy of your passport details page

Notification of decision
Assessment of a complete application usually takes between one and three weeks. You will receive formal notification by email. Your Letter of Offer will grant admission to UWA subject to satisfying any conditional requirements. You will be asked to complete a Proposed Study List which will go to your School, who will approve individual units of study.
Visit Completing Exchange at UWA for more information."
I am applying to come on exchange or study abroad to UWA. Where do I find UWA units (subjects or courses) which are available?,"You can find unit descriptions in the UWA Handbooks and you can check the current timetable to see the schedule for units. You may wish to read some notes on Unit Selection at UWA or in the FAQ at the bottom of the Student Exchange and Study Abroad at UWA page before selecting units.
When you submit your online application for the Student Exchange or Study Abroad program, you have the opportunity to submit a 'study list' made up of the selection of units you wish to enrol into while you're at UWA. If you meet the prerequisites, you may choose any units which are part of a recognised degree program across any of our schools to add to your study list (with the exception of units in Medicine, Dentistry, postgraduate Psychology and core Law units, which are not available to Exchange/Study Abroad students). The Global Learning Office will forward your study list to the relevant school to seek approval for your units and to check that you meet the University's prerequisites before your arrival. You will also have the opportunity to make changes and seek unit approval from the schools in person during Orientation week.
We strongly recommend you discuss the units you wish to take at UWA with your home university first, as you may need approval from them for the units you select.This will take additional time so make sure you allow for this."
Do I need to study full-time while I am at UWA as a Study Abroad or Exchange student?,"Incoming Study Abroad and Exchange students studying at UWA are expected to enrol in a full academic load to the value of 24 credit points per semester. This will generally comprise four (4) units (subjects/modules) per semester. Most units at The University of Western Australia have a value of six (6) credit points and are one (1) semester long. 

If your home university permits, you can study 18 credit points - generally three (3) six-point units as this is still considered a full time study load for student visa purposes."
"As a Study Abroad or Exchange student, will I receive credit for the units I study at UWA towards my degree at my home university?","It's your responsibility to satisfy your home college or university requirements and understand and fulfil credit transfer requirements. We recommend you discuss this with the Study Abroad Office at your home university first. They will inform you on whether you need to complete specific units to meet your home degree requirements.
As final enrolment is subject to timetabling constraints and unit availability, it is recommended approval is obtained for over and above the number of units required to fulfil a full academic load at UWA (a full academic load at UWA is 4 six-point units). This will allow some flexibility to change units if necessary.
Once you have chosen your units and sent them to us through your application or by email, we will seek approvals for you to take them, based on your transcript showing you have met any prerequisites required.
You may request a pre-approved study list prior to arrival as part of the online application process. This selection may be changed after you arrive in Perth by emailing us, or visiting your Student Advising Office.
Visit Completing Exchange at UWA for more information."
What do I do if I need to change my Approved Study List?,"If you need to add units to your Approved Study List (ASL) before you arrive in Australia you can simply email any units you wish to add to your Study Abroad Adviser at UWA. We will send them to the relevant school for approval.
Note: deadlines apply for receiving changes to your study list.
Once you have enrolled you can change your selection of units at any time up to the ADD/DROP deadline. All changes will need UWA school approval. Contact your Study Abroad Advisor for the deadlines in your study period and to get your units changed. 
It can be stressful getting approval from your home university once you are here at UWA due to time zone differences etc. We recommend you gain approval for a selection of units you may wish to do over and above the number of units required to fulfil a full academic load of 24 points at UWA before you leave your home country. This will allow some flexibility to change units if necessary once you enrol. For more information about unit selection, visit our website."
How much will student exchange to UWA cost?,"If your university has a formal university agreement with UWA, you can apply to study at UWA as an exchange student. This means you do not pay tuition fees to study at UWA, but continue to pay tuition fees at your home university.
If your home university does not have an exchange agreement with UWA, you can still study at UWA as a study abroad student. This means you pay tuition fees to UWA instead of to your home university. Tuition fees, application links and other information can be found here. 
You must pay for Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) as a condition of obtaining your Australian Student Visa.
You will also need to include your travel to Perth, your accommodation and living costs and any additional travel you wish to do in your budget planning. A breakdown of these costs is available on our Future Students site.

EU and UK students coming to UWA on student exchange are eligible to apply for a scholarship (Swiss and Norwegian students are excluded)."
Can I work in Australia while on student exchange to UWA?,"Everyone applying for a Student Visa will receive permission to work with their visa grant. On a Student Visa Grant you can work up to 40 hours per fortnight during semester, and no limits outside of study periods. However, you cannot start work until you have commenced your course in Australia. You do not need a visa label in your passport to show your employer that you have permission to work. Your visa information is held electronically by the Department of Home Affairs and can be accessed at any time for verification.
More information on visas can be found by visiting the Australian Department of Home Affairs."
How soon will I know if I have been accepted to go on exchange or study abroad to UWA?,"You will receive a formal notification of the outcome of your application within one to three weeks of UWA receiving a complete application. Notifications are sent by email only, and to the email address that your home university used to nominate you.

There are five residential colleges/halls on-campus which accommodate approximately 1000 students. The Colleges offer a furnished private room and two or three meals a day.

The colleges house students of different ages and backgrounds and are places where students can share academic and personal interests with other students. More importantly, they offer an environment where tutors and senior students help you during the transition from school or overseas to university. There are also social activities organised to help you balance the demands of study.

The Residential Colleges at UWA are:

University Hall
St Catherine's College
St George's College
St Thomas More College
Trinity

These colleges use a common application system: The UWA Residential Colleges Application Portal. You will rank the colleges you wish to live in by preference. If you do not receive an offer from your college of first preference, the portal will automatically send your application to your next highest preference. You do not need to have received your offer to apply for accommodation at the residential colleges, but note that there is a non-refundable application fee. 
The University also owns a number of unfurnished or partially furnished properties in Crawley Village close to the Crawley Campus that are available for UWA students.
Off-Campus Perth CBD Accommodation
Students wishing to live closer to the heart of Perth City may wish to consider two new purpose-built student accommodation options which have been endorsed by UWA. Both are located in Northbridge, Perth’s vibrant social and cultural precinct, and close to public transport. For more information visit their websites. Perth CBD student accommodation can be cheaper because there are no meals provided. Students can also save money by choosing a shared room. Don't forget to factor in the costs of food and transport to the UWA campus in your budgeting.
Accommodation close to the University is in high demand and more expensive than other areas. The UWA Accommodation Office maintains listings of both vacant and shared accommodation available to students in areas surrounding the campus. The Accommodation Office does not evaluate the accommodation or negotiate on your behalf with the owner/agent. You are responsible for judging the quality, suitability and safety of the accommodation.

You can look for accommodation by:

Reading advertisements placed on notice boards around campus
Contacting real estate agents
Getting help from other students who are familiar with the university area"

Assessment usually takes between one and three weeks (this can be longer if all the application material is not provided). You'll receive formal notification by email.
Your Letter of Offer will grant admission to UWA, subject to satisfying the appropriate prerequisites for the units you have nominated. It will ask you to complete a proposed study list. If you are required to have a list of units approved before you leave home, we recommend you complete this list and forward it to us as soon as possible. Your proposed study list will be assessed and an approved study list forwarded to you before you leave for Perth so you can enrol before Orientation Week. You may change this selection at any time before enrolment by emailing Study Abroad. If you do not need to have your units pre-approved you can change your units after you arrive in Perth. You can also change your enrolled units after you have arrived in Perth, until the first Friday of the semester.
Note: UWA does not send out physical documents by regular mail. All official correspondence will be via email."
Do I need to purchase insurance for my exchange or study abroad period at UWA?,"All applicants for an Australian Student Visa (and their dependants) must be covered by acceptable health insurance cover during the whole period of study in Australia by purchasing Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC). This is a compulsory Australian government requirement and applies to all international students except where special government arrangements between certain countries are in place (New Zealand, Norway, Belgium and Sweden).
Overseas Student Health Cover cannot be replaced by another policy that is provided by your home university/country. More information about OSHC, including the list of Australian Government-approved providers, can be found on the Private Health web site.
Students coming on a Working Holiday Visa (eligible countries only) will need to take out comparable travel insurance."

If you are granted Permanent Residency after you have commenced studies and before the census date of the semester in which you are enrolled, you must provide evidence of your visa subclass to Student Administration. You will normally keep your place as a student* and can request a refund for International Fees paid in that semester.
If you are granted Permanent Residency after you have commenced studies and after the census date of the semester in which you are enrolled, you must provide evidence to Student Administration. You will normally keep your place as a student* and although you are unable to claim a refund for fees paid so far, you will be liable for the Domestic Fee rate thereafter.
Please ensure you request instructions from Student Administration regarding your obligations as a Domestic Student.
*Note: courses which have strict quotas for International students may no longer have a place for you in that program. Such courses include the Doctor of Medicine, the Doctor of Dental Medicine, the Master of Pharmacy and the Master of Clinical Audiology."
Which is the best course to study to get Permanent Residency (PR) status?,"UWA staff are not permitted to give any advice on the best course to study to gain permanent residency and cannot act or advise as migration agents.  
 
You will need to contact the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs for this advice."
Do I have to attend Orientation if I am an international student?,"All students (Domestic and International, Postgraduate and Undergraduate) are expected to attend Orientation. The Orientation program is designed to assist you with your transition into your studies at UWA.
For International Students, Orientation also provides specific information about what is legally required of you as an International student at UWA, so it is very important that you attend.

Orientation activities are held the week before each semester commences. New students can access a personalised Orientation timetable, which details exactly which activities they need to attend and when, by logging into the UniStart website and clicking on ""Plan your Orientation""."
Is student health cover compulsory for international students?,It is an Australian Government Department of Home Affairs visa regulation that all student visa holders maintain valid Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of their student visa.
Can I work if I am an international student?,"If you are a student visa holder, you and your dependent family members have permission to work as a condition of your visa. You and your family members must not breach the work conditions that apply to your student visa.

Student visa work restrictions were relaxed throughout the pandemic and completely removed in January 2022 to allow primary and secondary student visa holders to work over their normal limit of 40 hours per fortnight to address workforce shortages. This will end on 30 June 2023. 
From 1 July 2023, work restrictions for student visa holders will be re-introduced and capped at the increased rate of 48 hours per fortnight. This ensures that student visa holders are able to focus on obtaining a quality Australian education and qualification while remaining able to support themselves financially, gain valuable work experience, and contribute to Australia’s workforce needs. 
For more information see our media release Addressing skills shortages in key industries and rebuilding the international education sector.
Work conditions for student visa holders
You cannot work until you have commenced your course in Australia. Once your course has commenced you are permitted to work a maximum of 48 hours per fortnight when your course is in session, and unlimited hours when your course is out of session. Work that is formally registered as part of your course is not included in the 48 hours per fortnight limitation.
The Department of Home Affairs website has an example of how the 48 hours a fortnight is calculated under Condition 8105 working restriction.
As information about visa conditions may change, student visa holders should refer to their particular conditions and check on the Home Affairs web page for the breakdown of each condition.
Fortnights
Most student visas allow you to work for up to 48 hours every fortnight (two weeks) while your course is in session, and unrestricted hours during any scheduled course break. Before you undertake any paid work, you need to make sure your visa allows you to work. If you exceed the number of hours you are entitled to work, you will be non-compliant with the work limitation and may be subject to visa cancellation.
Defining course in session and out of session
The Department of Home Affairs considers your course to be in session:

for the duration of the advertised semesters, including exam periods. Refer to the published dates
when you are undertaking another course, during a break from your main course and points from that course will be credited to your main course

They consider your course to be out of session:

during scheduled course breaks
if you have completed your course as scheduled (as per the dates listed on your CoE) and still hold a valid student visa

Elective courses with work requirements
Work won't count towards the 48-hour limitation if the work was specified as a requirement of the course when the course particulars were entered in the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS). If an elective is a requirement of the course but the work itself was not specified when the course was registered with CRICOS, you can still complete these electives, but it would be counted towards the 40-hour work limitation. This may be the case even if you are not being paid for undertaking the work. However, volunteer work, that is work that would not normally be paid, may be exempt. Always check with the Department of Home Affairs if you have any concerns – telephone 131 881.
 
Additional information about student visa work conditions
You can view your visa online using Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO). VEVO is a free service available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It allows you, and your employer (with your permission), to view your visa details online.
 
For more information about permission to work while studying, visit the Department of Home Affairs website. If you hold a visa other than a Student Visa, please contact the Department for information about any restrictions that may apply to your visa, telephone 131 881.

Can my dependent children attend school in Western Australia if I am a postgraduate international student?,"The dependent children of students studying a Masters by Coursework; Masters by Research and Doctor of Philosophy (can be full fee paying or sponsored) attending The University of Western Australia can be placed into government schools that have spare capacity.  A tuition fee waiver will only apply whilst the visa holder is enrolled in full-time postgraduate studies at a recognised Western Australian university. It does not apply before or after the study period.  
Students in receipt of a scholarship that also sponsors their dependent children will be required to pay mainstream tuition fees for overseas fee-paying students.  
All students are required to pay annual contribution charges to the public primary or secondary school their child/ren attend. 
Admission is on the following basis, as advised by TAFE International Western Australia (TIWA).
Conditions of Entitlement:

You must be studying a Masters by Coursework; Masters by Research or Doctor of Philosophy and be the holder of a Student Visa subclass 573, 574 or 500.
Your dependent child(ren) must be physically in the country before a school placement is requested.
Only public schools approved by the Department of Education and Training will be approached by TIWA.
You must not approach the government schools directly regarding the enrolment of your dependant. 
You are responsible for meeting the full costs of providing education support if your dependant has a disability or learning difficulty.
You are responsible for meeting the full tuition costs of providing your dependant with an English as a Second Language program, if considered necessary.

Once your dependant is in Western Australia, you can complete the required school placement request form found on our website and return it, and the necessary attachments to schooling-ic@uwa.edu.au .  Your forms will be forwarded to TIWA to seek a placement. 
TIWA advises that placements for compulsory schooling will receive priority. Placements for kindergarten will only be made when requests for compulsory schooling have been completed (Kindergarten is NOT compulsory).
Ideally, children will be placed in a school as close as possible to their local address. However due to the high demand for places in Western Australian public schools, places in your local school and other nearby schools may not be available. The available school may be some distance from the family’s place of residence and may not be near the university. This may require the child/ren to undertake travel on public transport in order to attend school, or for the family to live closer to the child's school.
A change of school will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.   
Commonwealth Government and University Sponsored Students
Students who are in receipt of a full scholarship for tertiary studies, awarded by the Commonwealth of Australia or The University of Western Australia, will be requested to complete the TIWA Confirmation of Tertiary Scholarship Form. The dependent children of these students are eligible for the same enrolment entitlement as local children for the duration of their parent's study period only.

I have received an offer; can I accept the offer and pay my international fees later?,"You cannot accept your offer and pay at a later date. A Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) will only be issued after your first payment (as listed on your offer letter or on the online acceptance portal) is made. You will only be able to enrol in your course after first payment is made.
You are advised to make your first payment as early as possible to allow sufficient time, as you are required to submit your CoE to apply for your student visa."
Can I pay my fees by instalment if I am an international student?,"You are not able to pay your fees by instalment throughout the semester. If you're an existing student, your Statement of Account will be issued on studentConnect one month prior to the commencement of each semester.
Payment extensions may be granted to students who have recently experienced significant, unexpected circumstances beyond their control that have impacted on their ability to make on-time payment of tuition fees for the upcoming semester.
In order to be considered for an extension, please visit the Fees website, complete the application form and submit it to the Fees Office.
There are a few important things for you to note:

As an international student visa holder it is a condition of your UWA Acceptance Contract, CoE and student visa that you have access to sufficient funds to pay all fees on time throughout your degree, and so extension requests are not granted lightly.
Before submitting your application, please ensure that all fees for previous semesters have already been paid; extensions will only be considered for tuition fees due in the upcoming semester. If an extension is granted, all fees must be paid by the last date of the teaching period for the coming semester, which is before the exam period.
In gathering your supporting documentation it’s important to remember to include details of your income and expenses to help you determine whether your proposal to pay all fees before the end of semester is realistic.
The current financial difficulties that you are experiencing should be a temporary circumstance; you will need to be able to show that the financial difficulties will have been resolved before next semester to ensure you don't need a further extension.

Other support services:
Sometimes when experiencing financial difficulties there can be other contributing factors, such as academic difficulties. If you would like to talk with someone about how you are progressing with your studies, your finances, or any other matters, there are excellent support services available to you. You might like to get in contact with the International Student Support team, your Student Advising Office, the Student Guild, or Wellbeing and Counselling Services."

I am an international student. How do I get help with my undergraduate application?,"There are two ways you can apply to study with us.

Does UWA provide accommodation for international students?,"Staff at the International Centre are unable to find accommodation for international students.
There are a number of options for housing for students at UWA.

UWA is unable to guarantee housing for exchange students; however, the following options may help in your search for accommodation:

On-campus Accommodation
There are five residential colleges/halls on-campus which accommodate approximately 1000 students. The colleges offer a furnished private room and three meals a day.

The colleges cater for students of different ages and backgrounds and are places where students can share academic and personal interests with other students. More importantly, they offer an environment where tutors and senior students help you during the transition from school or overseas to university. Regular social activities are organised to help you balance the demands of study.

The Residential Colleges at UWA are:

University Hall (previously known as Currie Hall)
St Catherine's College (female college)
St George's College
St Thomas More College
Trinity

The colleges are located on Stirling Highway, Nedlands opposite UWA campus. Based on 2012 prices, the cost of accommodation averages AU$375 per week, for the academic year (calculated on 34 weeks). There is an Application Fee of $60 which is non-refundable.

Apply as early as possible.  We recommend approximately four months prior to the start of semester.  You do not require an offer of a place at UWA to apply for residential accommodation.
Temporary On-campus Accommodation
Students can apply for initial temporary on-campus accommodation, whilst looking for permanent accommodation, using an on-line application accessed via the application tracking site   Students are advised to apply as soon as possible. You can also use this form to apply for the airport pickup service which is free to all first-time UWA international students.

To access the application tracking site, your username is either your email address on your application or UWA student number.  Your pin/access code was emailed to you on receipt of your application.  

Off-campus Accommodation
Accommodation close to the university is usually in high demand and more expensive than other areas. The university Housing Office maintains listings of both vacant and shared accommodation available to students in areas surrounding the campus.

The Housing Office does not evaluate the accommodation or negotiate on your behalf with the owner/agent. You are responsible for judging the quality, suitability and safety of the accommodation.

You can look for accommodation by:

Searching the listings at the UWA Housing Office database at Student Services and the Housing Office.
Looking in the community newspapers and local newspapers (The West Australian and Sunday Times) under the rental section.
Reading advertisements placed on notice boards around campus.
Contacting local real estate agents.
Getting help from other students who are familiar with the area.

 
You are strongly advised not to send a deposit or bond to an off-campus accommodation provider before arriving in Perth and viewing the accommodation in person."
Am I a domestic or international student?,"You are an Australian domestic student if you are:

an Australian citizen;
an Australian permanent resident (holders of all categories of permanent residency visas, including humanitarian visas), or
a New Zealand citizen.

You are an international student if you are:

a temporary resident (visa status) of Australia,
a permanent resident (visa status) of New Zealand, or
a resident or citizen of any other country.


If you are unsure whether you fit into any of the above categories you can get clarification from Department of Home Affairs."
What are the benefits of studying an undergraduate degree at UWA?,"Our experience-rich curriculum and global network prepares you for the ever-changing world outside your degree. Kick-start a successful career and join our accomplished graduates in becoming global professionals, driving change and shaping the future.
Gain real-world, practical experience
We’ll provide you the environment to build technical skills and valuable connections through hands-on learning, internships, work integrated learning, volunteering for credit and more.
Build your industry network

At UWA you join a community, not just a university. Make lifelong personal connections with more than 140 clubs and societies to choose from. Enjoy an unrivalled student lifestyle and socialise with people who value the same things you do."
Why do I need to take ‘broadening units’ under UWA's course structure?,"All students studying a bachelor's degree at UWA are required to broaden their studies by completing a minimum of four units (24 points) outside their degree-specific major. 
 
You can satisfy this requirement by:

Selecting any four units outside your degree-specific major
Completing a second major
Completing a minor

If you are studying a Combined Bachelor's and Master's degree (CBM), you can meet this requirement simply by completing the postgraduate units that form an integral part of your course. However, we encourage you to use the free elective units in your course to study other disciplines. 
 
Broadening is your opportunity to explore other areas of interest, investigate new disciplines and knowledge paradigms, and to shape your degree to suit your own aspirations and interests. Your course adviser will be able to suggest broadening units that are relevant to your major and your career aspirations – but remember, there is no wrong way to broaden your degree!"
How long will my email address be valid for after I have graduated?,"Unless there are special circumstances, you will be unable to access your UWA student mailbox, other services in Office 365 and other UWA apps after 12 months from when you completed your course. Access to your UWA Student mailbox cannot be restored after this date. 

Note: this is not the day you pass your exams, or your graduation day, but the day where your course status is recorded as completed. This also applies after 28 days, if you discontinue your course or the course is cancelled, unless you enrol in a new course in that time.
In the last month of access you will receive notifications of your access expiring which will be sent to your UWA email address.
Keeping a copy of your email and files:

For email, the only supported method is to export your mailbox to a PST file, that can be opened by a PC or Mac version of Outlook software (part of Office 365 Pro Plus or Office 365 Home subscriptions or a copy of Office Pro Plus such as Outlook 2016 or 2019).  The best way to achieve this is to follow this article. You will need to organise this before your access expires.
For your files in Student Drive (OneDrive), you can simply access OneDrive, login with your Uni-ID and choose to download folders that you wish to keep to your PC or Mac. This article provides more information. When Student Teams and SharePoint (Sites) are made available, you will use the same approach.

For your files, download (or Sync) your files down to your PC or Mac before your access expires.
Notifying your contacts:
You may wish to notify your contacts that you will no longer be contactable on your UWA email address before your access expires. Consider either:

composing an email to your contacts letting them know of an alternative email address
setting up an 'Out of office' response with your new contact details – instructions on doing this are available

What happens at the in-person Enrolment Help Drop-in Sessions?,"Enrolment Help Drop-in Sessions are held at our Crawley (Perth) campus in our computer labs. At these sessions staff and student volunteers will be available to provide one-on-one assistance with completing your enrolment online via studentConnect. You will then be able to register for classes via the Class Allocation System (CAS).
Full details of Enrolment and Class Allocation System Help Drop-in Sessions are published on the UniStart website. UniStart is your go-to place for a step-by-step guide on accepting your offer, enrolment and Orientation at UWA.
For information about enrolments at our Albany Campus, please refer to the Albany Centre."
When are enrolments?,"Enrolment Help drop-in sessions for new students will be held before the start of semester. Information about when these are run is on the UniStart website.
These sessions are optional and all eligible students are encouraged to enrol online following the steps on the UniStart website. Full details of help sessions (including dates and times) will be published on the UniStart website, closer to the date.
Online re-enrolment for the next academic year opens in mid-November on studentConnect.
Enrolment dates are published on our Current Students website.
If you need further assistance enrolling online via studentConnect you can contact Student Administration at Student Central or Email Us."
What is ACE?,"Academic Conduct Essentials (ACE) is an online compulsory unit that introduces you to principles of ethical scholarship and expectations for correct academic conduct at university.  ACE is a compulsory unit for all UWA coursework students and you will be automatically enrolled into the unit.  ACE will be on your enrolment record in studentConnect as either AACE1000 or AACE4000 Academic Conduct Essentials.  You can access ACE via the LMS.
ACE has four modules of content to review and a final quiz to complete for each module, you must achieve a score of 80% or higher across the quizzes to successfully pass the unit and you can take the quiz as many times as you like until the unit's completion date and only your highest score is recorded.
For more information, visit the ACE website."
"↵
Who has to do ACE?","All coursework students commencing a UWA course must complete ACE (Academic Conduct Essentials), even if you have already completed ACE while enrolled in another course at UWA and will be automatically enrolled into the unit. 
Exchange students and AccessUWA students are not required to complete ACE."
When do I need to complete ACE?,"ACE (Academic Conduct Essentials) is a compulsory unit for coursework students and must be completed within the first semester of your course enrolment, even if you have previously completed ACE while enrolled in another course at UWA. If ACE is not successfully completed within this timeframe, you will receive a grade of NC (Not Complete) and an ACE encumbrance will be applied to your student record.  The encumbrance will restrict you from accessing your grades for all the units you are enrolled in, it will also prevent graduation, re-enrolment and the ordering of official student documents.
Check your LMS for the required completion date of the ACE unit you are enrolled in.
Questions? Submit a question at www.uwa.edu.au/askuwa."
"I can't find ACE in my LMS, what should I do?","First check whether you are enrolled in ACE by going to studentConnect and looking at your current enrolment statement. If ACE doesn't appear on your enrolment, you may not be required to do the unit this semester. If you are enrolled in the unit (either AACE1000 or AACE4000 Academic Conduct Essentials), check which teaching period you are enrolled in.  ACE will appear in your LMS approx. one week before semester starts, look for it in the left-hand navigation panel within the 'Units' link.  If you are unable to see it, please Email Us to submit an enquiry - please include your name and student number in your correspondence."
How do I know if I have passed ACE?,"To successfully complete ACE you will need to achieve a score of 80% or more across the four quizzes.  You can check whether you have passed the ACE unit by selecting 'Your Grades' from the left-hand menu of the ACE homepage in the LMS. You will see a UP (Ungraded Pass) if you have successfully passed the unit, or a grade of NC (Not Complete) if you have not completed the unit.
If your highest score is less than 80% you can go back to the quizzes and try again as many times as you like until the unit's completion date.
Check your LMS for the required completion date of the ACE unit you are enrolled in."
Why doesn't studentConnect show that I have completed ACE when the LMS is showing that I have?,"ACE grades are uploaded at the end of the teaching period, appearing in studentConnect approximately 3 weeks after ACE closes. Grades will not appear on your academic transcript before this time, so even if you can see that you have completed ACE in the LMS, your enrolment status in studentConnect will be 'enrolled' until the teaching period closes."
"I am an exchange student, do I need to complete ACE?","Exchange students are not required to complete ACE.
Note: If you commence a standard UWA course, you will be required to complete ACE and will be automatically enrolled into the unit."
"I am a UWA University Extension student, do I need to complete ACE?","UWA University Extension students are not required to complete ACE.
Note: If you commence a standard UWA course, you will be required to complete ACE and will be automatically enrolled into the unit."
"Why have I been enrolled in ACE, when I have already completed it in a previous course at UWA?",You have been enrolled in ACE because you have commenced a new course of study at the University and are required to complete ACE again as part of your new course rules.
What happens if I do not complete ACE by the due date?,"You must complete ACE within the first semester of your course enrolment.  If you do not successfully complete ACE by the due date you will receive a grade of NC (Not Complete) on your academic transcript and an ACE encumbrance will be applied to your student record.  The encumbrance will restrict you from accessing your grades for all the units you are enrolled in, it will also prevent graduation, re-enrolment and the ordering of official student documents.
Reminder emails will be sent to your official UWA student email address."
"My ACE quiz final score does not appear on my academic record, should it?","ACE is an ungraded unit, which means the only grade recorded is either a UP (Ungraded Pass) when you have successfully passed the unit or NC (Not Complete), if you have not successfully completed the unit. 
All results are uploaded at the end of the teaching period, appearing approximately 3 weeks after the unit closes. Results will not appear in studentConnect before this time."
How do I access ACE?,"You can access ACE via the LMS using your Pheme credentials to login. ACE is compulsory for all coursework students, and you will need to complete it each time you commence a new course.  To achieve a pass grade for ACE you must pass the ACE quiz in the LMS.
Only those enrolled in the unit can access the assessment in the LMS.  UWA staff and students who are not enrolled in ACE can access the ACE modules at anytime by self-enrolling in the unit in the Community section of the LMS."
Do I have to work out my timetable for both semester 1 and semester 2 at the beginning of the year?,"You only need to complete your timetable for the coming semester. At the beginning of the academic year you will put together your semester 1 timetable using CAS. You will have an opportunity to complete your semester 2 timetable mid-year. 
For more information on how to complete your timetable you can read through the resources and watch the help videos on the CAS website. The key opening and closing dates for CAS are also available on the website.
If you encounter any problems or require assistance, you can submit an enquiry via Email Us and a staff member will assist you."
Can I get wireless internet access at other Universities if I am a UWA student or staff member?,"UWA students and staff can access the internet wirelessly at more than 500 participating institutions in over 70 countries worldwide via Eduroam. An active Pheme account and a mobile device or laptop computer with wireless capability is required. 
Note: You can only connect to Eduroam when visiting a participating institution. UWA staff and students cannot connect to Eduroam on UWA campuses.
Related article: How to connect to Eduroam"
How do I find my reading lists and access Unit Readings?,"Access to Unit Readings is provided through the Learning Management System (LMS) via the Unit Readings link on your unit page.
If you are unable to view Unit Readings through LMS please contact your Unit Coordinator in the first instance to ensure that a reading list has been made available for your unit.
You can find more information on the Unit Readings webpage."
How do I get a full-time/part-time sticker for my Campus Card?,"Once you have enrolled in your units, you can obtain a full-time (or part-time) enrolment sticker from Student Administration or Guild Student Centre.
These enrolment stickers show you are a current UWA student for a given academic year - some third parties do not accept stickers or student cards as proof of concession (for example Transperth) so it's important to check. The Guild, UWA Sports, and student Clubs will add their stickers if you are a member."
I am a current student at UWA; are student exchange arrangements (cross-institutional study) available at other Australian universities?,"Current UWA students can apply to study cross-institutionally at another Australian tertiary institution for credit towards their UWA degree. This is not part of the Student Exchange Program.
The opportunity for cross-institutional study is available to all current UWA students. Details about eligibility criteria, how to apply and application deadlines are available online under 'I want to study a unit at another university'.
Note: Students undertaking cross-institutional study in their final semester may not be able to graduate at the next end-of-semester graduation ceremony (July and December). Students must be able to provide UWA with their official formal academic record with finalised grades by the 'Course Requirements Completed' deadline advised by UWA Graduations.
Some Australian institutions will not have released their final results by that date, and those students will not be able to attend the next end-of-semester graduation ceremony. Students may choose to graduate at the next available monthly in-absentia ceremony, or delay graduation to the following ceremony."
What is UWA's undergraduate course model?,"At UWA we've expanded our range of bachelor’s degrees to meet growing demand for skills that address the needs of the Australian economy, industry and society. You'll have more options and more opportunities to specialise in your areas of interest, gaining a deeper level of understanding within your chosen field.
Our courses prepare you for a career with applied, practical learning and integrated industry engagement that give you a competitive edge when you enter the workforce. You can also tailor your degree to your goals by completing two majors within three years or by adding a minor area of study to complement your major.


Maybe you want to choose a bachelor's degree that allows you to take the time to explore different areas of interest and gain transferable skills and knowledge that will lead you towards a broad range of career outcomes. That's the path many people take when they first start uni.
Alternatively, you can choose a more focused and planned program of study where you'll gain a deep level of understanding within a chosen specialisation and develop the specific skills and knowledge you'll need to succeed within that chosen career. The choice is yours.


You can browse UWA's undergraduate degrees by your area of interest on our Future Students website."

What are my options following an undergraduate degree?,"After completing your undergraduate degree you may decide to seek employment or further your studies. 

Further study options include:

undertaking a postgraduate by coursework degree (Graduate certificate, Graduate diploma, Master's by coursework, Postgraduate professional degree) 
pursuing a research pathway beginning with Honours
studying an additional undergraduate major or degree 
studying a micro-credential through UWA Plus

The Future Students website can provide you with more information."
What is the value of a degree with honours?,"A bachelor's degree can be awarded with an ordinary pass or with honours.
Honours involves undertaking an additional year of study (or equivalent part-time) at the end of your bachelor's degree, and incorporates a combination of coursework and a dissertation, although this may vary from school to school.
Your honours study will enable you to develop your knowledge and skills as an independent researcher under the supervision of a member of staff with expertise in your chosen area.
Successfully completing an honours degree will not only prepare you for higher-degree study at master’s and PhD level, but will demonstrate to prospective employers a higher capacity for independent learning and research, along with enhanced problem-solving, critical thinking and communication skills.
To be eligible for admission to your chosen honours course at UWA, you must have successfully completed a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) from a recognised university, demonstrating a strong academic performance in the final-year units of the major you intend to undertake.
Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) take honours as a standard part of their four-year course."
How is undergraduate study different from postgraduate study?,"The first studies undertaken at university are generally referred to as undergraduate studies, designed to introduce students to the knowledge base within a specific discipline. A Bachelor's degree is the name of an award given to students upon completion of their undergraduate studies.
Postgraduate study refers to the range of courses available to students who have completed undergraduate studies. It requires a higher level of understanding, greater independence and more specialised knowledge than undergraduate study. Graduates with a Postgraduate degree are considered to be more highly qualified as a result.
Please refer to the Future Students website for more information."
How will I benefit from a professional degree at postgraduate level at UWA?,"Students who choose to pursue a professional qualification will complete a postgraduate course after finishing their undergraduate bachelor's degree course.
Studying a professional course at postgraduate level is in line with leading universities in other parts of the world. Having both an undergraduate and a postgraduate qualification will not only provide you with a stronger foundation, but will enhance opportunities by giving you a competitive edge in a global workforce when you enter your profession.
You will not need to overload your enrolment in order to complete your course in the standard timeframe, and will benefit from improved links with industry and professional practice as part of your postgraduate experience.
Visit the Future Students website to browse our Professional Courses.
Current students are welcome to discuss any plans for postgraduate study with an adviser in their assigned Student Advising Office."
Can I be guaranteed entry to a professional postgraduate course before I start at UWA?,"Our Assured Pathways combine your undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, allowing you to gain assured placement into both degrees.
To be considered for an Assured Pathway, you will be need to achieve the minimum rank required for each pathway. Different pathways have different entry requirements, please visit the pathway information page for more information.
You will also need to meet the progression conditions for your respective pathway during your undergraduate study in order to progress to postgraduate study."
Is it necessary to undertake postgraduate studies if I complete an undergraduate degree at UWA?,"After completing your undergraduate degree, you have the option of seeking employment or continuing your study path.
You may choose to undertake postgraduate studies to build your knowledge and skills through a coursework degree; extend the understanding of your subject while demonstrating advanced analytical and project management skills through a research degree; or obtain a professional qualification.

UWA students who choose to seek employment after completing their undergraduate degree have consistently enjoyed stronger employment rates when compared to graduates from other West Australian universities and, in nearly all fields, they also fare better than similar graduates from other Australian universities. The starting salary of UWA bachelor degree graduates has also consistently been at superior levels to that observed nationally. For further assistance you can visit the Careers Centre."
How do I apply for a course?,"Domestic applicants
Domestic applicants should refer to the information page and submit an application to the University’s online application portal.

International applicants
International applicants should either submit an application directly to the University’s online application portal or through an authorised UWA overseas representative.

It provides additional information about your course, The University of Western Australia and the Australian Higher Education system.
Please refer to the AHEGS website for further information.
Students who graduate from July 2018 onwards will be issued their AHEGS online via My eQuals. Digital documents issued via My eQuals are securely stored and available to you anytime and anywhere, saving you time and money. Once UWA has uploaded your document, you can use My eQuals to safely share your documents with anyone, at any time, for however long you like.
If you'd like to purchase a hard copy version of your AHEGS, you can place an order online via studentConnect."
How do I defer my studies?,"You need to apply for Approved Leave to take a semester or more off from your studies. You can apply for up to 12 months of Approved Leave at a time online via studentConnect.
To apply for Approved Leave:

Logon to studentConnect using your UWA Student ID Number and Pheme password
In the left hand menu under 'COURSE DETAILS' select 'Discontinuation/Approved Leave' and follow the prompts

For further information on Approved Leave (including eligibility and application deadlines) see 'How to take time off' at the Enrolment website.
For advice on how Approved Leave may affect your course progress and enrolment contact your Student Advising Office or Email Us."

If you have enrolled in a unit that runs in 'ONLINE' mode, choose the 'Face2Face' mode when you enrol via studentConnect. When doing your unit search on the timetable web page make sure it is related to the correct semester.

How do I know if I am doing well in my units?,"Ask your Unit Coordinator or tutor for feedback on your performance. Contact details and consultation times will be listed in the Unit Outline in LMS.
Check the marks and feedback you have received on assessment items you have completed so far. Your performance on these assessments is a good indication of your progress.

If you remain unsure or concerned about your progress, visit your Student Advising Office for direction."
Who marks my assignments?,"Check with your Unit Coordinator to determine who marks your assignment.

Any annual increase will not exceed 7.5% per annum. If you initially accepted your offer in the year prior to your commencement, you may have only made an initial payment on the basis of the previous year's tuition fees, and so when you commence the following year there may be a small outstanding balance to be paid."
How long before my tuition fee payment is received and reflects on studentConnect if I am an international student?,"Payment by BPay or Australia Post (POSTbillpay) will take approximately 3 - 5 working days.
Payment by Telegraphic Transfer will be updated when you present Student Central with a copy of the remittance advice or alternatively you can send a copy of your remittance advice via Email Us.

New students interested in this major should instead apply for the Bachelor of Music (BP008) or Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) (BP005) with Music extended major."

Why do I need a tax file number for enrolments?,"For a Commonwealth-supported place, you must complete an electronic Commonwealth Assistance Form (eCAF) through studentConnect, as you complete your enrolment.

To download a recording, on the ECHO360 page, use the Download link for a lecture. This can be found by selecting the green button on the right of recording and selecting Download original.  
All lectures in recording-enabled teaching spaces at all of the University campuses are recorded and all lecture recordings for the teaching period of a unit are continuously available and downloadable through the University’s Learning Management System (LMS) for students enrolled in the unit, until the end of the Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period for that particular unit. If the lecture recording is not downloadable contact your Unit Co-ordinator as copyright issues may be the reason.

What is Communication and Research Skills (CARS),"Communication and Research Skills (CARS) is an online unit that assists you in developing skills for finding information, assignment writing, presentations and teamwork.  CARS is compulsory for all UWA coursework students, and you will be automatically enrolled into the unit.

If you are required to complete CARS, the unit will appear on your enrolment record in studentConnect as CARS1000 or CARS4000 Communication and Research Skills and will be accessible via the LMS.
For more information, visit the CARS website."
I can't find the CARS unit in my LMS. What should I do?,"First, check that you are enrolled in CARS by going to studentConnect and looking at your enrolment statement.  If CARS doesn't appear on your enrolment in studentConnect, you may not be required to complete the unit in this teaching period.
If you are enrolled, the CARS unit (CARS1000/CARS4000) should appear in your LMS.  Look for the unit in the left-hand navigation panel within the 'Units' link.  If you are definitely enrolled in the unit and the teaching period you are enrolled into has commenced, and you are unable to see the unit in your LMS, please Email Us. Send us your full name, student number and query and we will investigate your CARS enrolment for you."
How do I access CARS?,"Communication and Research Skills (CARS) is a compulsory unit for all commencing coursework students at UWA. You can access CARS via the LMS using your Pheme credentials.
Only those enrolled in the unit can access the assessment in the LMS. The CARS content is freely available on our website."
"I didn't finish CARS by the due date, can I try again?","You will not be able to complete CARS after the teaching period you are enrolled in closes.  If you do not successfully complete the CARS unit in the LMS by your first enrolment, you will receive a grade of Not Complete (NC) and may be placed on probationary enrolment.  You will then be automatically enrolled into the next teaching period.
You must complete CARS in order to graduate.
The CARS content is freely available, but to record a pass grade for CARS, UWA students must complete the quizzes in the LMS."
What happens if I do not complete CARS by the due date?,"If you do not successfully complete CARS by the due date, you will receive a grade of Not Complete (NC) on your academic transcript and may be placed on probationary enrolment.  You will be automatically enrolled into the next teaching period to complete the unit.
You must complete CARS in order to graduate.  Reminder emails will be sent to your official UWA student email account."
How do I know if I have passed CARS?,"To successfully complete CARS you need to achieve a score of 80% or more across the four quizzes.  You can check whether you have passed CARS by selecting 'Your Grades' from the left-hand menu of the CARS homepage in the LMS. You will see a grade of UP (Ungraded Pass) if you have successfully passed the unit, or a grade of NC (Not Complete) if you have not successfully completed the unit.
If your highest score is less than 80% you can go back to the quizzes and try again as many times as you like until the unit's completion date.
Check your LMS for the required completion date of the ACE unit you are enrolled in."
Why doesn't my final quiz score appear on my academic record?,"Your academic record only records whether or not you successfully completed the CARS unit, not the exact score you got on the quiz.  You will get either an 'Ungraded Pass (UP)' or a 'Not Complete (NC)'.
An 'Ungraded Pass' indicates that you completed the unit successfully; a 'Not Complete' grade indicates you did not meet the requirements of the unit.
All grades for CARS are uploaded to students' academic records after the unit closes. While the CARS unit you are enrolled in is open, you can view your grade at any time using the Your Grade link in the LMS menu."
Who has to do CARS?,"All commencing coursework students enrolled in a new course at UWA are required to complete CARS and will be automatically enrolled into the unit.  Once you have successfully completed CARS you will not be required to complete it again.
Exchange students and AccessUWA students do not need to complete CARS."
Do I need to complete CARS if I am a UWA University Extension student?,"UWA University Extension students are not required to complete CARS. However, if you would like to look through the CARS information modules you can do so at the CARS website."
What is PROSH?,"The 2023 PROSH will be held on Wednesday 22 March from 5:00am - 12:00pm.

Every year, a team of dedicated student writers get together to produce the PROSH paper, a 20+ page newspaper of satirical content on current affairs locally, globally and internationally.
Thousands of UWA students hit the streets of Perth on PROSH Day, rattling tins and handing out papers in exchange for donations.

"Are the MD (Doctor of Medicine), DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) and DPM (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine) Commonwealth Supported (CSP) courses?","In January 2013 DIISRTE (The Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education) approved the MD (Doctor of Medicine), DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) and DPM (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine) as Masters by Coursework programs for student income support. However, this does not automatically mean you will be eligible for student income support. The process for approval for income support for Masters by Coursework is not related to gaining Commonwealth-supported places in a course."
What does the study ‘mode’ mean for my units?,"UWA is now offering units in a variety of modes which students can choose when enrolling via studentConnect. The definitions below will assist with your study mode selection:

If you have already selected a mode and would like to change your preference, please read: Changing my study mode
 
If you're an international student who is overseas you must be enrolled in online versions only and you have a query about your study plan and online units, contact your Student Advising Office."
How do I view my current units in studentConnect?,"You can view the units you are enrolled in via studentConnect by following these steps:

Log on to studentConnect using your UWA student ID number and Pheme password
Go to the COURSE DETAILS menu
Select ""Online Enrolment""
Click ""Begin online enrolment""
Click on the ""3. Units"" icon. You can then see Unit details and status (ENROLLED / DISCONTINUED / INVALID / COMPLETED etc).

Contact your Student Advising Office if you have queries regarding your enrolment."
What is student network storage?,"Student Network Storage is a legacy file storage provided on the central UWA network to support older applications and services that need a physical location for files and folders. It may also be used by some university computers (including Library computers) for default storage and some course content.
Student Drive is recommended for your personal work-related storage and collaboration with others. This cloud-based service uses OneDrive as part of the Microsoft Office 365 service provided to all current students and accessed using your Uni-ID login (studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au and password). This has an initial 1TB available storage for you to use on your personal devices from the cloud and share content with others. Instructions are available for switching from H: Drive to OneDrive.
If you need to use the Student Network Storage, you can access your Student Network storage in two ways:

Via the H: Drive on student computers subject libraries and general purpose computer labs. When you save to 'My Documents' your work will be saved to the H: Drive. Ensure you save your work in 'My Documents' as work saved to the desktop or in the temporary download folder (typically used by browsers when opening email attachments) will be erased when you log out of the PC.
Through UniDrive access via your own computer/device.

You have access to two different areas within your network storage:

H: Drive - this is your personal home drive, which can hold up to 2 gigabytes (2GB) of data.
T: Drive - this is a shared space which will automatically give you access to course related content for the units you are enrolled in.  Work saved to this location will be cleared every 30 days.  As such it is not recommended that you save work in this location and opt to use other tools such as Microsoft Teams when collaborating and sharing with others.

More information
More information is available on the Student email and collaboration tools web page.
 
Contact the University Library for help or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
Why can't I log in to a computer in the library using my Pheme credentials?,"If you can't log in please try the following:

Have you entered your credentials correctly? You must use your Pheme credentials and passwords are case and space sensitive - please check to see whether caps lock is on.
Are you currently an enrolled student? If your enrolment status is not current and active, your Pheme access may be suspended.
Has your Pheme password expired? Pheme passwords need to be updated every 6 months and an email reminder is sent to your student email in the weeks leading up to expiry.
After 9 incorrect password attempts you must wait 15 minutes before trying again. Your Pheme credentials will lock but automatically become available again after 15 minutes.
Try logging in to Pheme first. Log in to the computer using the guest access ""All other patrons"" and navigate to Pheme. If your log in is successful, use these credentials to log in to the computer. If unsuccessful, you will need to change your password. 
If you have previously saved an old password on any device, it will automatically try to connect once you are in range on campus (especially your Unifi wifi password). This will block your access after nine attempts as well.

For additional help, contact a staff member in the University Library or Email Us to submit an enquiry."
What is UniConnect?,"UniConnect is the UWA virtual private network (VPN) service for current students. This can link your personal computer via remote VPN when you are off campus (e.g. at home) to the UWA campus network providing access to online resources which are available only to users while connected on-campus.
Note: students located in mainland China may experience limitations in using UniConnect. If you are a student studying from China, you will need to use the FortiClient VPN software for remote access. Instructions for requesting access, installing, configuring and connecting are available here.
To connect to UniConnect:

Set up the UniConnect network on your device before using UniConnect for the first time.
Select the UniConnect network from the list of available networks.
Verify your identity via Multi-factor authentication (MFA) using the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device. 
Note: your MFA sign in method must be set to 'Microsoft Authenticator - Notification'

Whilst connected to UniConnect you should be aware all internet traffic will pass through the UniConnect connection and UWA's network and is subject to the Computer and Software Use Regulations.
More information about UniConnect is available on UniConnect Access and Instructions."
What is a Nominated Completion Year/Period?,"Your Nominated Completion Year/Period is the year and period that you expect to complete the requirements of your course.

If you expected to complete your course at the end of Semester 1 in 2023, your Nominated Completion Year/Period would be ""Mid 2023"".
If you expected to complete your course at the end of Semester 2 in 2023, your Nominated Completion Year/Period would be ""End 2023"". 

Your Nominated Completion Year/Period is automatically recorded when you first enrol. Every time you re-enrol, you are asked to check and update your Nominated Completion Year/Period.
It is important to make sure this information is correct, because it is used to send out invitations to graduate and manage conferral of awards. You can change your Nominated Completion Year/Period in studentConnect."
How do I change my Nominated Completion Year/Period?,"To change your Nominated Completion Year/Period, log on to studentConnect.

Find the Enrolments heading in the left hand column.

At the bottom of the next screen, you will see the heading Completion, and the sub-heading Nominated Completion Year/Period. 
Click the Change these values button next to the sub-heading.
Enter your new expected completion year, and select Mid or End as your period. 
Click Update Details.

If you need any advice on your eligibility to complete your course, please speak with your Student Advising Office."
What do I do if I find a timetable clash after my teaching period starts?,"You should first check whether you can resolve the clash yourself by changing to another time in CAS as the clash may involve classes for which other time slots are available.
If the classes at other suitable times are showing as 'full', you should contact the unit administrator using the contact details provided in CAS to ask whether it is possible to obtain a place in the 'full' class. Your CAS unit administrator contact details will be visible in the ""Message"" box which will appear above the available class times when you click on an activity in CAS.
If the clash involves a lecture, and there are no alternative times available, you may have the option of watching an online recording of the lecture via LMS (Learning Management System). Check your unit outline before taking this option to ensure all lectures for your unit are recorded.
Note: this option only applies to some lectures - other class types (e.g. tutorials and laboratories) will not be recorded and are usually compulsory to attend.
If there are no alternative options for either of the clashing classes, contact the Transition Services team via Email Us function on this website and selecting 'Timetable or Class Allocation Help' from the drop down list, or your CAS unit administrator using the instructions above, for assistance."
"If I withdraw after the census date and I have deferred the payment of the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF), will I still have an SA-HELP debt?","If you withdraw from units after the relevant census date you will remain liable for the SA-HELP debt after the census date. 
The University of Western Australia is not permitted to remove this debt once it has been incurred as a HELP debt."
How do I redirect my student email?,"The UWA Student Email Service provides the ability for students to forward their email to another address.
Important Note: you can place a redirect on your student account to forward your emails to a personal email account, however; this is not recommended as the UWA email address provided is regarded as the only digital communication address trusted by UWA as representing you as a student. As this Student Email is also how to collaborate with others and gain access to rooms and resources available to students, you may not be able to collaborate effectively with UWA students and staff if you place a redirect on your student email account. It also introduces significant risk that your mail may be not be delivered or may be delayed. Future enhanced services offered by UWA may also not function.
If you do need to forward your student email, we strongly recommend that you tick the option to “Keep a copy of forwarded messages” as this will prevent you from permanently losing messages. If you do forward your email, the University cannot accept responsibility if you do not receive messages forwarded to another email address, or they are lost by choosing not to leave a copy on the student email system.
For more information and step-by-step instructions on re-directing your email, please visit this help article."
What is my student email and how do I access it?,"All students currently enrolled at UWA are automatically assigned an email address. Your email address will be in the format of:
studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au ie: 12345678@student.uwa.edu.au
To access your student email, ensure you have activated your Pheme account and you have ticked the terms & conditions button for full internet access. You can access your student email account using your Uni-ID (studentnumber@student.uwa.edu.au) and Pheme password:

Directly via https://mail.student.uwa.edu.au/
via the link on the Students website

You need to ensure that you have set up multi-factor authentication to access your student email off campus. 
 
For further information refer to UWA's student email system."
Where can I do my printing?,"Printing, scanning and copying are easy at UWA as all libraries and general purpose computer labs offer the same type of multifunction printer (MFP). The MFP does it all – print, scan or copy, in colour and a range of sizes – and you simply tap your Campus Card to begin. You can submit print jobs to the print queue from a university computer by selecting the global printer from your printer list or from your own computer using WebPrint. Once submitted, your print job will be held for 12 hours in a secure global print queue.
You can pay for photocopying and printing in libraries using your Campus Card. It costs 5c per side for an A4 page to photocopy or print in black and white. There are additional charges for colour photocopying and larger formatting. Use the autoloader machines in each library to add money to your card. Autoloaders accept EFTPOS and credit cards.. You can also add value online (via Pheme Login) using a credit card. 
Be aware unused printing credit left on your card cannot be refunded
PaperCut is the printing management software used to store your printing jobs and other information. You can access PaperCut through the WebPrint website or from the desktop of a university computer by selecting the details button on the printing pop-up or the lock/printer/person icon on the menu bar. Step-by-step instructions for using WebPrint or printing from a university computer can be found on the library's website.
More information is available on the Printing, copying and scanning web page. If you need help with photocopying or printing feel free to ask University Library staff."
How do I print from my laptop in libraries?,"UWA Students and Staff can print from their own laptops in libraries using Unifi and WebPrint, please follow the links for further instructions for using both.
You will need to have funds loaded onto your Campus Card to enable printing. Once you have sent a document to print (WebPrint service supports several common file formats), you will need to tag onto a printer terminal to release it.
More information is available on the Printing, copying and scanning web page. If you need help with scanning, photocopying or printing please feel free to ask the friendly University Library staff."
My print job is 'delayed' what does this mean?,"Sometimes print jobs are delayed due to the size or format of the documents, or there is a high volume of print jobs in the global printing queue. General printing tips are available, which may help if your document fails or takes a long time to print. Most importantly, the file size should be under 250MB.
If you have released your job on a printer and the blue lights are flashing, the job is still being sent to the printer - this can take upwards of 10 minutes for very large files.
If you have released your job on a printer and the white light is flashing, the job is being processed by the printer and is in the process of being printed.
Further information can be found on the Printing, copying and scanning page. If you require further help please call into any of the libraries and speak to the friendly staff."
Can I use my own device to print to a University Library printer?,"UWA staff and students can use their own computer to print from any of the University Library printers using Web Print over the Unifi wifi network. You must have the document saved on your computer as a permitted file type and be connected to the internet. Documents that are large, or have images and algorithms embedded, can take a long time to load and may fail to print.   
Note that Web Print has simplified printing options and does not support printing multiple slides to a page, or printing a specific page range in a document.
You can use these document printing guidelines to ensure your document prints.
Note: Web Print does not work on Apple iOS devices."
What do I do if I have clashes in CAS?,"If you have a clash after your class preferences have been processed, a red icon will appear next to the activity where a clash has occurred. Selecting the activity will display a clash button which can be selected and a message will appear providing information on which classes clash.
There are two types of clashes in CAS:
1. A Fixable Clash
This is where another class time is available for you to attend for at least one of your classes. To fix this, log in to CAS and adjust your allocations. You can edit your allocations up until approximately 2 weeks into semester, check the CAS website for specific dates.
2. An Unfixable Clash
This is where you have a clash with no other options to choose from. Either all the other class times are full, or there isn't another choice at all. If two lectures clash, you can contact any member of the First Year Experience Team at UniStart for advice. If a lecture clashes with another type of class, such as a studio, tutorial, or workshop (or if two of these clash), you can contact your school via the contact message given in CAS for that class. Alternatively you can contact your unit coordinator given in the Handbook 
 Contact details for your Student Advising Office can be found in studentConnect when you log in. There are also links to the school contacts on the Current Students web page.
More information is available at: Getting help with your timetable and class allocations."
Is the Early Learning Centre an approved service for the Child Care Subsidy?,The Early Learning Centre is an approved child care service. For more information on Commonwealth Government child care subsidy payments contact the centre.
Can I take a tour of the Early Learning Centre?,Tours of the Centre are only offered once a position is available for your child as we try to minimise disruptions to the children and staff. Please take a look on our website where you can take a virtual tour of the rooms.
What is the likelihood of a vacancy in the Early Learning Centre during the year?,"Vacancies occur each January, which is when the older children leave for school and the younger children graduate to the next age group.

(eg start dates from January to March; April to June)"
Can I start my child later than the date the Early Learning Centre has offered?,You can only start your child later than the offered date if you pay full fees for the offered days until your child commences. Please be mindful you will only receive Child Care Subsidy when your child ‘physically’ attends the service.
What time does the Early Learning Centre open and close?,Children can arrive from 7.45am and the Centre closes at 5.45pm. We do recommend that parents collect their children by 5.30pm so they can have an informative hand over from the educators.
Do I have to pay Early Learning Centre fees when my child is sick or going on a holiday?,"Full fees do apply, however the Child Care Subsidy pays for up to 42 days per year when a child does not attend and if there is not any approved supporting documentation such as a doctor's certificate."
Does the Early Leaning Centre offer hourly care?,"Hourly care is not an available option at the Early Learning Centre. The Centre is open for 10 hours each day and a daily rate is applied, however, you use the Centre hours as you wish. If your child attends 5 hours or the full 10 hours the daily rate still applies."
Does the Early Leaning Centre offer casual care?,Casual days of care can be organised if there is availability but only for children that are currently enrolled at the Centre.
Do I have to pay for Public Holidays at the Early Learning Centre?,"Public Holidays are part of the fee and all days must be paid for even if the Centre is closed (except at the end of the year). The days that the Centre is closed and fees apply are:

Australia Day
Good Friday
Easter Monday
ANZAC Day (and if ANZAC day falls on a weekend)
Labour Day
Western Australia Day
Queen's Birthday"
Does the Early Learning Centre close over the Christmas period?,The Centre usually closes for approximately 1-2 weeks in line with The University of Western Australia's Christmas holiday period. When this closure occurs fees are not charged for the period of closure.
Can I salary package my Early Learning Centre fees?,"Salary packaging of Early Learning Centre fees is only available for employees of The University of Western Australia. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a current contract with the salary packaging department at Human Resources (HR) and that you sign and complete the salary packaging form provided to you by the Centre or on the HR website, and return the form to HR for processing.
Note: any family that salary packages their fees will NOT be entitled to the Child Care Subsidy (CCS).
For further details please contact Salary Packaging."
Can I drop by and visit my child at the Early Learning Centre?,Parents of currently enrolled children are welcome to visit at any time of the day and encouraged to call ahead of time when possible.
Can I breastfeed at the Early Learning Centre?,"Mothers who are breastfeeding can come to the Centre to feed their baby. We have a private Parent Room located just off the foyer or you are more than welcome to breastfeed in your child’s room. On request, educators can telephone parents when their baby is ready for their next feed."
What is the notice period at the Early Learning Centre?,"If you wish to change your days of care or give notice for your position, four weeks’ notice is required in writing via email."
At what age can my child start after school care and/or vacation care at UWA Out of School Care?,"UWA Out of School Care has been provided with a licence under Section 48, Education and Care Services National Law (WA) Act 2012 to operate with a maximum of 39 school aged children. This effectively means the centre is licensed for children aged over pre-school age – that is, attending full time pre-primary or older. Unfortunately, UWA Out of School Care does not accept Kindergarten children.
Children attending full time pre-primary for the first time will be allowed to attend the centre:

from February for after school care and 
April for vacation care"
Is there a discount of Out of School Care fees for families that have more than one child?,"Out of School Care fees have been set per child/day. To assist in the reduction of your fees you can register for the Child Care Subsidy, or apply for Salary Packaging (UWA employees ONLY)."
"What is the difference between the daily, casual and weekly rates for after school care?","Effective January 2022 we only offer a daily and casual rate for After School Care.
Daily rate means you hold a place for a regular booking. The booking remains the same for the entire year unless you change it.  If you wish to cancel any days, you are required to give two weeks' notice in writing.  You will be charged for absences and public holidays that fall within the term time.  There is flexibility to swap days within the week if your child is not able to attend on a particular day, if available. You can also add days as ‘one offs’ as required.  
Casual rate is a few $ more than the daily rate. You can book a care session at short notice and cancel at short notice without penalty.  This is good for people who have varying circumstances each week. Casual placements are subject to places being available on the day."
Does the Out of School Care service deliver children to Uniswim at Human Movement?,"During after school care Out of School Care staff are quite willing to walk the children down to the pool for their lessons and hand them over to a swim teacher.  However, children are not collected from Uniswim due to varying finish times."
